Welcome to [The IO Foundation](https://TIOF.Click/TIOFWeb)'s GitHub repository.

As part of its organization strategy, The IO Foundation treats its own internal functioning as another project.

This public repository will allow you to:
- Monitor the progress of TIOF's advocacy. 
- Understand TIOF's needs (and maybe support the organization and its advocacy)


Please note that this space is currently a work in progress and is scheduled to be released sometime in the first semester of 2021.
