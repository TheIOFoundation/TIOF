Challenges

Technologists face a number of challenges that are stopping them from taking an active role in architecting and building better and safer digital spaces. Until these challenges aren't addressed, they will largely remain external actors and not embrace their role as NextGen Rights Defenders.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Technologists are the people designing and building the technology everyone is so concerned about.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

TIOF has identified the following challenges:

* **Challenge 1:** Lack of taxonomies\
  Why: Without a common, clear, technical language describing Digital Harms or Digital Rights it is impossible for a technologist to envision what are the repercussions of technology to both citizens and their digital twins.
* **Challenge 2:** Lack of financial incentives\
  Why: Civil Society does not have comparable financial means as Corporate or Governments. The lack of career advancement rewards can't be appealing when the alternatives can be very lucrative; even more so when debt is introduced in the equation.
* **Challenge 3:** Lack of tools and knowledge to become that change\
  Why: Minimizing frictions for technologists will scale their adoption of their role as NextGen Rights Defenders.&#x20;

## Supporting the NextGen&#x20;

### DCDR Principles

### CrowdShape
