### To Big Tech

The IO Foundation has used your platform with the sole purpose of communicating information related to its advocacy and events.

We do not endorse in any way possible malpractices on collecting users' data as a result of their interaction with it and invite you to revisit your business model accordingly.

{% hint style="info" %}
In particular, we invite you to revise your technology stack and pivot towards the observance of the [DCDR Principles](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciples).
{% endhint %}

### To the citizen

The IO Foundation has used this platform with the sole purpose of communicating information related to its advocacy and events.

We understand that its usage may have become fundamental in your daily activities and needs. It is important to understand, however, that this platform may be collecting more information about you than you expect or wish or even consented to.

{% hint style="info" %}
We encourage you to take a stand on this matter and demand that the platform operates in accordance to the [DCDR Principles](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciples).
{% endhint %}

Should the platform not change in the way they operate, we encourage you to stop using it and move towards alternatives that focus on keeping your data secure and away from abuse.

### About the use of Social Media by TIOF

The IO Foundation believes that free, open communication is key to face and solve the challenges that digital societies are experiencing and therefore any technological means of communication should enable the discovery of solutions instead of focusing on data extractionism.

We deplore "Cancel Culture" and invite citizens and platforms to be more open and acceptant of both scientific facts (those that made possible the existence of technology to being with) and opinions that may not conform to mainstream ideologies.

{% hint style="info" %}
The IO Foundation will work tirelessly on finding a balance between generating awareness among citizens and technologists and using platforms that do not ensure the protection of their digital twins.
