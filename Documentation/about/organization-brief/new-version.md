### <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/DCDR Icon-01.png" alt="" data-size="line"> Data-Centric Digital Rights

TIOF views the technology as currently non-correlated with all working understandings and practices as to how any public-consumption industry functions traditionally where a clear separation is made between:

* Experts, who understand the complexities to design and build products that are compliant with applicable legislation and
* Citizens, who are solely tasked for being responsible users of the product

In essence, DCDR is a framework for technologists composed by Principles, Taxonomies and other technical tools. It enables them to develop a deeper understanding about the nature of data, the digital twins that emerge from it and make possible for them to embrace their role as [NextGen Rights Defenders](https://tiof.click/TIOFNextGen).



{% hint style="success" %}
By understanding that [_we are our data_](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciple1), technologists may architect digital spaces that aim at [_ending remedy_](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciple2) and build it so that they implement [_Rights by design_](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciple3).

### BHR in Tech

The BHR in Tech initiative aims at encouraging a shift towards the adoption and implementation of the [United Nations' Guiding Principles in Business and Human Rights](https://tiof.click/BITUNGP) in the Tech sector by

* designing and producing implementation guidelines and other research materials
* participating actively in the drafting of National Action Plans (NAPs) so that tech is considered as a thematic area or, to the very least, as a cross-cutting theme
* increase the recognition of the importance of technology in different jurisdictions through their National Action Plans
* reviewing existing National Action Plans (NAPs)&#x20;
* increase awareness and adoption across tech companies

### <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/[TIOF UDDR] Comms [P] Logo FC T HiRes XXX v1.0.png" alt="" data-size="line"> Universal Declaration of Digital Rights

The UDDR initiative is a multi-stakeholder initiative promoted by The IO Foundation to promote and achieve the proclamation of a Universal Declaration of Digital Rights.

> _**Building trustworthy technology that protects your Data-Centric Digital Rights.**_

{% hint style="info" %}
As core stakeholders, technologists play a critical role as the [Next Generation of Rights Defenders](https://tiof.click/TIOFNextGen) and need to orient themselves through new design and implementation paradigms focused on protecting data. The [DCDR Principles](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciples) put forward by The IO Foundation are concepts that help them navigate the intricacies of applying Human and Digital Rights in digital infrastructures, products and services.
