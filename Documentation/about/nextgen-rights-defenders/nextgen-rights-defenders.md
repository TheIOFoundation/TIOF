## Engaging the correct stakeholders

In the efforts to ensure that technology is designed and build in ways that are protective of citizens and their digital twins, the most important actor is largely non-engaged: Technologists.

They are the people tasked to architect and build the technology everyone is so much concerned about and yet they occupy, on a practical level, a marginal space in the whole conversation.

At The IO Foundation, _we recognize technologists, and most importantly programmers, as the Next Generation of Rights Defenders._

{% hint style="info" %}
**REMARK**

While TIOF recognizes that all technologists play an equally important part in building better and safer digital spaces, we concentrate our efforts towards programmers.

**Why?**\
Because any technology always has a last layer of software through which citizens interact with it. Helping programmers accelerates the impact of the DCDR advocacy.

## Challenges

{% hint style="danger" %}
Technologists are the people designing and building the technology everyone is so concerned about.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% columns %}
{% column %}
Technologists face a number of challenges that are stopping them from taking an active role in architecting and building better and safer digital spaces. Until these challenges aren't addressed, they will largely remain external actors and not embrace their role as NextGen Rights Defenders.


{% endcolumn %}

{% column %}

{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

TIOF has identified the following challenges:

{% columns %}
{% column width="41.66666666666667%" %}
**Challenge 1:** Lack of taxonomies\

{% endcolumn %}

{% column width="58.33333333333333%" %}
Why: Without a common, clear, technical language describing Digital Harms or Digital Rights it is impossible for a technologist to envision what are the repercussions of technology to both citizens and their digital twins.
{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

{% columns %}
{% column width="41.66666666666667%" %}
**Challenge 2:** Lack of financial incentives
{% endcolumn %}

{% column width="58.33333333333333%" %}
Why: Civil Society does not have comparable financial means as Corporate or Governments. The lack of career advancement rewards can't be appealing when the alternatives can be very lucrative; even more so when debt is introduced in the equation.
{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

{% columns %}
{% column width="41.66666666666667%" %}
**Challenge 3:** Lack of tools and knowledge to become that change
{% endcolumn %}

{% column width="58.33333333333333%" %}
Why: Minimizing frictions for technologists will scale their adoption of their role as NextGen Rights Defenders.&#x20;
{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}
