## **Unrestricted and Restricted resources**

In accordance to its Finance Policy, The IO Foundation categorizes all mobilized resources into two distinct categories:

### **Unrestricted resources**

These resources can be used at the discretion of the organization for any project, program, or operational need. Unrestricted resources offer flexibility in their allocation and are vital for the proper functioning of the organization. These resources are typically sourced from general donations, revenue from products or services or grants that do not specify usage.

### **Restricted r**esources&#x20;

Restricted resources are those designated for specific purposes, as defined by the donor, crowdfunding project deliverables or grantor. These resources must be used strictly for the projects, programs or activities outlined in by the source's requirements.
