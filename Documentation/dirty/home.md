## Digital Rights Principles

### I am my Data

The traditional understanding of data as separate entities from their users is anchored in past perceptions and the use of legacy technologies. The reality is much different: The data representing users (and of which they should have control of consent) is intimately and inextricably linked to them; it models them, creating an accurate representation that loses all value should that contextualization ever be severed.

The direct consequence is that a user’s data IS the user itself.

This proposition has severe consequences as the same duties of care that apply by constitutional laws to citizens should equally apply to the data representing them. In this sense, the necessary infrastructures that governments put in place to protect their citizens (hospitals, highways, the judiciary,...) should also be extended to the management and protection of their data with a national cloud system based on open standards and governed by a framework on Digital Rights.

### End Remedy

The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights1 (BHR) are the modern transposition of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) into the corporate scene. They are an attempt to nurture a corporate sector that observes and respects Human Rights by incorporating their principles across all of their operations. The UNGPs are structured around 3 Pillars, namely: Pillar I: The State duty to protect Pillar II: The Corporate responsibility to respect Pillar III: Access to Remedy

From a proactive perspective on the use of technology (and therefore data protection), the objective should always be to avoid the occurrence of grievances, in turn minimizing the need for any remedy along the use of any technological products and services.

End Remedy represents the embodiment of the proactive planification, design and implementation of all necessary mechanisms, both in policy and technology, to avoid grievances to ever happen during the use of a product or a service, in turn minimizing the need for legal actions. In the context of Digital Rights, it implies the design of policies that protect users and the implementation of such provisions in a transparent, trustworthy and safe manner where legal remedies, while defined, are only employed as a last resort safety net.

Instilling this approach to the relevant stakeholders, namely in this case programmers is a critical step to ensure that End Remedy becomes second nature when designing digital products and services.

### Rights by Design

Initiatives such as the SDGs10, UNGPs9 or Privacy by Design7 are set in place to define a clear international framework on Human Rights and the defense of their Privacy; together with constitutional law, they collectively conform the Rights that citizens worldwide could and should benefit. Digital Rights frameworks should foster not only policies that protect users’ data, they should be accompanied by the necessary technical specifications (based on open standards) to implement them. Rights by Design is the approach of policies and technology being designed around the Rights of citizens and their data to observe them in their planification, architecture and implementation, transparently for all stakeholders. It ensures that users do not require to be experts in digital technologies and instead the infrastructure will ensure that their Rights are being observed transparently, creating no cause for remedy.
