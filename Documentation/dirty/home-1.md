## About TIOF

The IO Foundation (TIOF) is a global for-impact NGO advocating for Data-Centric Digital Rights. Born from a fundamental concern about the state of Digital Rights in the world, its mission is to promote, protect and provide solutions for Digital Rights, thus aiming to bridge technological and humanitarian perspectives. As data becomes an increasingly powerful economic, political, and social force, programmers are emerging as the next generation of Human and Digital Rights defenders. Following its vision of a world where Human Rights and Digital Rights are one and the same, TIOF aims to raise awareness of the importance of Digital Rights in collaboration with other organizations, both from civil society and bodies of governance.

## Dhatham House Rule

The DHATHAM v0.5 House Rule, which is an evolution from the CHATHAM House rule in response to the new digital realities, stipulates:

When a digital interaction, or part of thereof, is held under the DHATHAM House Rule, participants are free to use the information received and to produce digital materials (audio, photos, video) yet neither the identity nor the affiliation of contributors or participants may be revealed, tagged or implied without their expressed consent.

In other words, be considerate and ask for permission before capturing a digital representation of others or posting about them on social media or any other digital medium.

Note: The Dhatam House Rule is a live statement that is open for adaptation and improvements.

To participate in the next iteration of the rule, check the [Dhatam House Rule live discussion](http://tiof.click/DhathamBuild).

There remains, however, a limited international understanding of the impact of technology on human rights. Following its vision of a world where Human Rights and Digital Rights are one and the same, TIOF aims to raise awareness of the importance of Digital Rights in collaboration with other organizations, both from civil society and bodies of governance.
