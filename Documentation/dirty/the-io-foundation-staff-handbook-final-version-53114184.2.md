(Equal opportunities policy)

1. **Equal opportunities statement**
   1. The IO Foundation is committed to promoting equal opportunities in employment. You and any job applicants will receive equal treatment regardless of age, disability, gender reassignment, marital or civil partner status, pregnancy or maternity, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation (**"Protected Characteristics"**).
2. **About this policy**
   1. This policy sets out our approach to equal opportunities and the avoidance of discrimination at work. It applies to all aspects of employment with us, including recruitment, pay and conditions, training, appraisals, promotion, conduct at work, disciplinary and grievance procedures, and termination of employment.
   2. This policy does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.
3. **Discrimination**
   1. You must not unlawfully discriminate against or harass other people including current and former employees, job applicants, clients, customers, suppliers and visitors. This applies in the workplace, outside the workplace (when dealing with customers, suppliers or other work-related contacts), and on work-related trips or events including social events.
   2. The following forms of discrimination are prohibited under this policy and are unlawful:
      1. **Direct discrimination:** treating someone less favourably because of a Protected Characteristic. For example, rejecting a job applicant because of their religious views or because they might be gay.
      2. **Indirect discrimination:** a provision, criterion or practice that applies to everyone but adversely affects people with a particular Protected Characteristic more than others, and is not justified. For example, requiring a job to be done full-time rather than part-time would adversely affect women because they generally have greater childcare commitments than men. Such a requirement would be discriminatory unless it can be justified.
      3. **Harassment:** this includes sexual harassment and other unwanted conduct related to a Protected Characteristic, which has the purpose or effect of violating someone's dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them. Harassment is dealt with further in our Anti-harassment and Bullying Policy.
      4. **Victimisation:** retaliation against someone who has complained or has supported someone else's complaint about discrimination or harassment.
      5. **Disability discrimination:** this includes direct and indirect discrimination, any unjustified less favourable treatment because of the effects of a disability, and failure to make reasonable adjustments to alleviate disadvantages caused by a disability.
4. **Recruitment and selection**
   1. Recruitment, promotion and other selection exercises such as redundancy selection will be conducted on the basis of merit, against objective criteria that avoid discrimination. Shortlisting should be done by more than one person if possible.
   2. Vacancies should generally be advertised to a diverse section of the labour market. Advertisements should avoid stereotyping or using wording that may discourage particular groups from applying.
   3. Job applicants should not be asked questions which might suggest an intention to discriminate on grounds of a Protected Characteristic. For example, applicants should not be asked whether they are pregnant or planning to have children.
   4. Job applicants should not be asked about health or disability before a job offer is made, except in the very limited circumstances allowed by law: for example, to check that the applicant could perform an intrinsic part of the job (taking account of any reasonable adjustments), or to see if any adjustments might be needed at interview because of a disability. Where necessary, job offers can be made conditional on a satisfactory medical check. Health or disability questions may be included in equal opportunities monitoring forms, which must not be used for selection or decision-making purposes.
5. **Disabilities**
   1. If you are disabled or become disabled, we encourage you to tell us about your condition so that we can consider what reasonable adjustments or support may be appropriate.
6. **Part-time and fixed-term work**
   1. Part-time and fixed-term employees should be treated the same as comparable full-time or permanent employees and enjoy no less favourable terms and conditions (on a pro-rata basis where appropriate), unless different treatment is justified.
7. **Breaches of this policy**
   1. We take a strict approach to breaches of this policy, which will be dealt with in accordance with our Disciplinary Procedure. Serious cases of deliberate discrimination may amount to gross misconduct resulting in dismissal.
   2. If you believe that you have suffered discrimination you can raise the matter through our Grievance Procedure or Anti-harassment and Bullying Policy. Complaints will be treated in confidence and investigated as appropriate.
   3. You must not be victimised or retaliated against for complaining about discrimination. However, making a false allegation deliberately and in bad faith will be treated as misconduct and dealt with under our Disciplinary Procedure.

(Anti-harassment and bullying policy)

1. **About this policy**
   1. The IO Foundation is committed to providing a working environment free from harassment and bullying and ensuring all staff are treated, and treat others, with dignity and respect.
   2. This policy covers harassment or bullying which occurs at work and out of the workplace, including at work-related events or social functions. It covers bullying and harassment by staff and also by third parties such as customers, suppliers or visitors to our premises.
   3. This policy does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.
2. **What is harassment?**
   1. Harassment is any unwanted physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct that has the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them. A single incident can amount to harassment.
   2. It also includes treating someone less favourably because they have submitted or refused to submit to such behaviour in the past.
   3. Unlawful harassment may involve conduct of a sexual nature (sexual harassment), or it may be related to age, disability, gender reassignment, marital or civil partner status, pregnancy or maternity, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation. Harassment is unacceptable even if it does not fall within any of these categories.
   4. Harassment may include, for example:
      1. unwanted physical conduct or "horseplay", including assault, touching, pinching, pushing, grabbing and intentionally blocking normal movement or interfering with work;
      2. unwelcome sexual advances, suggestive behaviour, invitations or comments (which the harasser may perceive as harmless);
      3. offensive e-mails, text messages or social media content;
      4. mocking, mimicking or belittling a person's disability;

**verbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory jokes or comments or slurs;**

**visual displays such as derogatory or sexually-oriented posters, photography, cartoons, drawings or gestures.**

*
  1. A person may be harassed even if they were not the intended "target". For example, a person may be harassed by racist jokes about a different ethnic group if the jokes create an offensive environment.

1. **What is bullying?**
   1. Bullying is offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour involving the misuse of power that can make a person feel vulnerable, upset, humiliated, undermined or threatened. Power does not always mean being in a position of authority, but can include both personal strength and the power to coerce through fear or intimidation.
   2. Bullying can take the form of physical, verbal and non-verbal conduct. Bullying may include, by way of example:
      1. physical or psychological threats;
      2. overbearing and intimidating levels of supervision;
      3. inappropriate derogatory remarks about someone's performance;
   3. Legitimate, reasonable and constructive criticism of a worker's performance or behaviour, or reasonable instructions given to workers in the course of their employment, will not amount to bullying on their own.
2. **If you are being harassed or bullied**
   1. If you are being harassed or bullied, consider whether you feel able to raise the problem informally with the person responsible. You should explain clearly to them that their behaviour is not welcome or makes you uncomfortable. If this is too difficult or embarrassing, you should report their behaviour as soon as possible, who can provide confidential advice and assistance in resolving the issue formally or informally.
   2. If informal steps are not appropriate, or have not been successful, you should raise the matter formally under our Grievance Procedure.
   3. We will investigate complaints in a timely and confidential manner. The investigation will be conducted by someone with appropriate experience and no prior involvement in the complaint, where possible. Details of the investigation and the names of the person making the complaint and the person accused must only be disclosed on a "need to know" basis. We will consider whether any steps are necessary to manage any ongoing relationship between you and the person accused during the investigation.
   4. Once the investigation is complete, we will inform you of our decision. If we consider you have been harassed or bullied by an employee the matter will be dealt with under the Disciplinary Procedure as a case of possible misconduct or gross misconduct. If the harasser or bully is a third party such as a customer or other visitor, we will consider what action would be appropriate to deal with the problem. Whether or not your complaint is upheld, we will consider how best to manage any ongoing working relationship between you and the person concerned.
3. **Protection and support for those involved**
   1. Staff who make complaints or who participate in good faith in any investigation must not suffer any form of retaliation or victimisation as a result. Anyone found to have retaliated against or victimised someone in this way, or made accusations under this policy in bad faith, will be subject to disciplinary action under our Disciplinary Procedure.
4. **Record-keeping**
   1. Information about a complaint by or about an employee may be placed on the employee's personnel file, along with a record of the outcome and of any notes or other documents compiled during the process. These will be processed in accordance with our Data Protection Policy.

(Anti-corruption and bribery policy)

1. **About this policy**
   1. It is our policy to conduct all of our business in an honest and ethical manner. We take a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption and are committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships.
   2. Any employee who breaches this policy will face disciplinary action, which could result in dismissal for gross misconduct. Any non-employee who breaches this policy may have their contract terminated with immediate effect.
   3. This policy does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and we may amend it at any time. It will be reviewed regularly.
2. **Who must comply with this policy?**
   1. This policy applies to all persons working for us or on our behalf in any capacity, including employees at all levels, directors, officers, agency workers, seconded workers, volunteers, interns, agents, contractors, external consultants, third-party representatives and business partners.
3. **What is bribery?**
   1. **"Bribe"** means a financial or other inducement or reward for action which is illegal, unethical, a breach of trust or improper in any way. Bribes can take the form of money, gifts, loans, fees, hospitality, services, discounts, the award of a contract or any other advantage or benefit.
   2. **"Bribery"** includes offering, promising, giving, accepting or seeking a bribe.
   3. All forms of bribery are strictly prohibited. If you are unsure about whether a particular act constitutes bribery, raise it with \[_insert name_].
   4. Specifically, you must not:
      1. give or offer any payment, gift, hospitality or other benefit in the expectation that a business advantage will be received in return, or to reward any business received;
      2. accept any offer from a third party that you know or suspect is made with the expectation that we will provide a business advantage for them or anyone else;
      3. give or offer any payment (sometimes called a facilitation payment) to a government official in any country to facilitate or speed up a routine or necessary procedure.
   5. You must not threaten or retaliate against another person who has refused to offer or accept a bribe or who has raised concerns about possible bribery or corruption.
4. **Gifts and hospitality**
   1. This policy does not prohibit the giving or accepting of reasonable and appropriate hospitality for legitimate purposes such as building relationships, maintaining our image or reputation, or marketing our products and services.
   2. A gift or hospitality will not be appropriate if it is unduly lavish or extravagant, or could be seen as an inducement or reward for any preferential treatment (for example, during contractual negotiations or a tender process).
   3. Gifts must be of an appropriate type and value depending on the circumstances and taking account of the reason for the gift. Gifts must not include cash or cash equivalent (such as vouchers), or be given in secret. Gifts must be given in our name, not your name.
   4. Promotional gifts of low value such as branded stationery may be given to or accepted from existing customers, suppliers and business partners.
5. **Record-keeping**
   1. You must declare and keep a written record of all hospitality or gifts given or received. You must also submit all expenses claims relating to hospitality, gifts or payments to third parties in accordance with our expenses policy and record the reason for expenditure.
   2. All accounts, invoices, and other records relating to dealings with third parties including suppliers and customers should be prepared with strict accuracy and completeness. Accounts must not be kept "off-book" to facilitate or conceal improper payments.
6. **How to raise a concern**
   1. If you are offered a bribe, or are asked to make one, or if you suspect that any bribery, corruption or other breach of this policy has occurred or may occur, you must report it in accordance with our Whistleblowing Policy as soon as possible.

### Conduct outside of Work <a href="#_toc256000104" id="_toc256000104"></a>

#### We do not seek to interfere with the personal lives or conduct of our staff. However, some times of conduct outside of work can interfere with our legitimate business interests. You are expected to conduct your personal affairs in a manner that doesn't adversely affect the integrity, reputation or credibility of yourself of The IO Foundation. Illegal or immoral conduct outside of work by any member of staff that adversely affects our legitimate business interests, or the member of staff's ability to perform his or her job, will not be tolerated.

1. **About this policy**
   1. We are committed to conducting our business with honesty and integrity and we expect all staff to maintain high standards. Any suspected wrongdoing should be reported as soon as possible.
   2. This policy covers all staff including employees, officers, consultants, contractors, volunteers, interns, casual workers and agency workers.
   3. This policy does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.
2. **What is whistleblowing?**
   1. Whistleblowing is the reporting of suspected wrongdoing or dangers in relation to our activities. This includes bribery, facilitation of tax evasion, fraud or other criminal activity, miscarriages of justice, health and safety risks, damage to the environment and any breach of legal or professional obligations. It also includes the following matters specific to this workplace.
3. **How to raise a concern**
   1. If you have any whistleblowing concerns, you should contact \[_insert name_].
   2. We will arrange a meeting with you as soon as possible to discuss your concern. You may bring a colleague or union representative to any meetings under this policy. Your companion must respect the confidentiality of your disclosure and any subsequent investigation.
4. **Confidentiality**
   1. We hope that staff will feel able to voice whistleblowing concerns openly under this policy. Completely anonymous disclosures are difficult to investigate. If you want to raise your concern confidentially, we will make every effort to keep your identity secret and only reveal it where necessary to those involved in investigating your concern.
5. **External disclosures**
   1. The aim of this policy is to provide an internal mechanism for reporting, investigating and remedying any wrongdoing in the workplace. In most cases you should not find it necessary to alert anyone externally.
   2. The law recognises that in some circumstances it may be appropriate for you to report your concerns to an external body such as a regulator. We strongly encourage you to seek advice before reporting a concern to anyone external. Protect operates a confidential helpline. Their contact details are at the end of this policy.
6. **Protection and support for whistleblowers**
   1. We aim to encourage openness and will support whistleblowers who raise genuine concerns under this policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken.
   2. Whistleblowers must not suffer any detrimental treatment as a result of raising a genuine concern. If you believe that you have suffered any such treatment, you should inform \[_insert name_] immediately. If the matter is not remedied you should raise it formally using our Grievance Procedure.
   3. You must not threaten or retaliate against whistleblowers in any way. If you are involved in such conduct you may be subject to disciplinary action.\[In some cases the whistleblower could have a right to sue you personally for compensation in an employment tribunal.
   4. However, if we conclude that a whistleblower has made false allegations maliciously, the whistleblower may be subject to disciplinary action.
   5. Protect operates a confidential helpline. Their contact details are at the end of this policy.

(Disciplinary and capability procedure)

1. **About this procedure**
   1. This procedure is intended to help maintain standards of conduct and performance and to ensure fairness and consistency when dealing with allegations of misconduct or poor performance.
   2. Minor conduct or performance issues can usually be resolved informally. This procedure sets out formal steps to be taken if the matter is more serious or cannot be resolved informally.
   3. This procedure applies to all employees regardless of length of service. It does not apply to agency workers or self-employed contractors.
   4. This procedure does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.
2. **Investigations**
   1. Before any disciplinary hearing is held, the matter will be investigated. Any meetings and discussions as part of an investigation are solely for the purpose of fact-finding and no disciplinary action will be taken without a disciplinary hearing.
   2. In some cases of alleged misconduct, we may need to suspend you from work while we carry out the investigation or disciplinary procedure (or both). While suspended, you should not visit our premises or contact any of our clients, customers, suppliers, contractors or staff, unless authorised to do so. Suspension is not considered to be disciplinary action.
3. **The hearing**
   1. We will give you written notice of the hearing, including sufficient information about the alleged misconduct or poor performance and its possible consequences to enable you to prepare. You will normally be given copies of relevant documents and witness statements.
   2. You may be accompanied at the hearing by a trade union representative or a colleague, who will be allowed reasonable paid time off to act as your companion.
   3. You should let us know as early as possible if there are any relevant witnesses you would like to attend the hearing or any documents or other evidence you wish to be considered.
   4. We will inform you in writing of our decision as soon as reasonably practicable after the hearing.
4. **Disciplinary action and dismissal**
   1. The usual penalties for misconduct or poor performance are:
      1. **Stage 1: First written warning or improvement note.** Where there are no other active written warnings or improvement notes on your disciplinary record, you will usually receive a first written warning or improvement note. It will usually remain active for six months.
      2. **Stage 2: Final written warning.** In case of further misconduct or failure to improve where there is an active first written warning or improvement note on your record, you will usually receive a final written warning. This may also be used without a first written warning or improvement note for serious cases of misconduct or poor performance. The warning will usually remain active for 12 months.
      3. **Stage 3: Dismissal or other action.** You may be dismissed for further misconduct or failure to improve where there is an active final written warning on your record, or for any act of gross misconduct. Examples of gross misconduct are given below (paragraph 6). You may also be dismissed without a warning for any act of misconduct or unsatisfactory performance during your probationary period.

We may consider other sanctions short of dismissal, including demotion or redeployment to another role (where permitted by your contract), and/or extension of a final written warning with a further review period.

1. **Appeals**
   1. You may appeal in writing within one week of being told of the decision.
   2. The appeal hearing will, where possible, be held by someone other than the person who held the original hearing. You may bring a colleague or trade union representative with you to the appeal hearing.
   3. We will inform you in writing of our final decision as soon as possible, usually within one week of the appeal hearing. There is no further right of appeal.
2. **Gross misconduct**
   1. Gross misconduct will usually result in dismissal without warning, with no notice or payment in lieu of notice (summary dismissal).
   2. The following are examples of matters that are normally regarded as gross misconduct:
      1. theft or fraud;
      2. physical violence or bullying;
      3. deliberate and serious damage to property;
      4. serious misuse of the organisation's property or name;
      5. deliberately accessing internet sites containing pornographic, offensive or obscene material;
      6. serious insubordination;
      7. unlawful discrimination, victimisation or harassment;
      8. bringing the organisation into serious disrepute;
      9. serious incapability at work brought on by alcohol or illegal drugs;
      10. causing loss, damage or injury through serious negligence;
      11. a serious breach of health and safety rules;
      12. a serious breach of confidence.
   3. This list is intended as a guide and is not exhaustive.
3. **About this procedure**
   1. Most grievances can be resolved quickly and informally through discussion. If this does not resolve the problem you should initiate the formal procedure set out below.
   2. This procedure applies to all employees regardless of length of service. It does not apply to agency workers or self-employed contractors.
   3. This procedure does not form part of any employee's contract of employment. It may be amended at any time and we may depart from it depending on the circumstances of any case.
4. **Step 1: written grievance**
   1. You should put your grievance in writing and submit it to \[_insert name_].
   2. The written grievance should set out the nature of the complaint, including any relevant facts, dates, and names of individuals involved so that we can investigate it.
5. **Step 2: meeting**
   1. We will arrange a grievance meeting, normally within one week of receiving your written grievance. You should make every effort to attend.
   2. You may bring a companion to the grievance meeting if you make a reasonable request in advance and tell us the name of your chosen companion. The companion may be either a trade union representative or a colleague, who will be allowed reasonable paid time off from duties to act as your companion.
   3. If you or your companion cannot attend at the time specified you should let us know as soon as possible and we will try, within reason, to agree an alternative time.
   4. We may adjourn the meeting if we need to carry out further investigations, after which the meeting will usually be reconvened.
   5. We will write to you as soon as reasonably practicable after the last grievance meeting, to confirm our decision and notify you of any further action that we intend to take to resolve the grievance. We will also advise you of your right of appeal.
6. **Step 3: appeals**
   1. If the grievance has not been resolved to your satisfaction you may appeal in writing to \[_insert name_], stating your full grounds of appeal, within one week of the date on which the decision was sent or given to you.
   2. We will hold an appeal meeting, normally within two weeks of receiving the appeal. This will be dealt with impartially by someone who has not previously been involved in the case. You will have a right to bring a companion (see paragraph 3.2).
   3. We will confirm our final decision in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after the appeal hearing. There is no further right of appeal.

(Sickness absence policy)

1. **About this policy**
   1. This policy sets out our arrangements for sick pay and for reporting and managing sickness absence.
   2. Abuse of sickness absence, including failing to report absence or falsely claiming sick pay will be treated as misconduct under our Disciplinary Procedure.
   3. This policy does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.
2. **Reporting when you are sick**
   1. If you cannot attend work because you are sick or injured you should telephone your manager as early as possible and no later than 30 minutes after the time when you are normally expected to start work.
3. **Evidence of incapacity**
   1. You must complete a self-certification form for sickness absence of up to seven calendar days.
   2. For absence of more than a week you must obtain a certificate from your doctor stating that you are not fit for work, giving the reason. You must also complete a self-certification form to cover the first seven days. If absence continues beyond the expiry of a certificate, a further certificate must be provided.
   3. If your doctor provides a certificate stating that you "may be fit for work" you must inform us immediately. We will hold a discussion with you about how to facilitate your return to work, taking account of your doctor's advice. If appropriate measures cannot be taken, you will remain on sick leave and we will set a date for review.
4. **Statutory sick pay**
   1. You may be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) if you satisfy the relevant statutory requirements. Qualifying days for SSP are \[Monday] to \[Friday], or as set out in your employment contract. The rate of SSP is set by the government in April each year. No SSP is payable for the first three consecutive days of absence. It starts on the fourth day of absence and may be payable for up to 28 weeks.
5. **Return-to-work interviews**
   1. After a period of sick leave we may hold a return-to-work interview with you. The purposes may include:
      1. ensuring you are fit for work and agreeing any actions necessary to facilitate your return;
      2. confirming you have submitted the necessary certificates;
      3. updating you on anything that may have happened during your absence;
      4. raising any other concerns regarding your absence record or your return to work.
6. **Managing long-term or persistent absence**
   1. The following paragraphs set out our procedure for dealing with long-term absence or where your level or frequency of short-term absence has given us cause for concern. The purpose of the procedure is to investigate and discuss the reasons for your absence, whether it is likely to continue or recur, and whether there are any measures that could improve your health and/or attendance. We may decide that medical evidence, or further medical evidence, is required before deciding on a course of action.
   2. We will notify you in writing of the time, date and place of any meeting, and why it is being held. We will usually give you a week's notice of the meeting.
   3. You may bring a companion to any meeting or appeal meeting under this procedure. Your companion may be either a trade union representative or a colleague, who will be allowed reasonable paid time off from duties to act as your companion.
   4. If you or your companion cannot attend at the time specified you should let us know as soon as possible and we will try, within reason, to agree an alternative time.
   5. If you have a disability, we will consider whether reasonable adjustments may need to be made to the sickness absence meetings procedure, or to your role or working arrangements.
7. **Medical examinations**
   1. We may ask you to consent to a medical examination by a doctor or occupational health professional or other specialist nominated by us (at our expense).
   2. You will be asked to agree that any medical report produced may be disclosed to us and that we may discuss the contents of the report with the specialist and with our advisers. All medical reports will be kept confidential and held in accordance with our Data Protection Policy.
8. **Initial sickness absence meeting**
   1. The purposes of a sickness absence meeting or meetings will be to discuss the reasons for your absence, how long it is likely to continue, whether it is likely to recur, whether to obtain a medical report, and whether there are any measures that could improve your health and/or attendance.
   2. In cases of long-term absence, we may seek to agree a return-to-work programme, possibly on a phased basis.
   3. In cases of short-term, intermittent absence, we may set a target for improved attendance within a certain timescale.
9. **If matters do not improve**
   1. If, after a reasonable time, you have not been able to return to work or if your attendance has not improved within the agreed timescale, we will hold a further meeting or meetings. We will seek to establish whether the situation is likely to change, and may consider redeployment opportunities at that stage. If it is considered unlikely that you will return to work or that your attendance will improve within a short time, we may give you a written warning that you are at risk of dismissal. We may also set a further date for review.
10. **Final sickness absence meeting**
    1. Where you have been warned that you are at risk of dismissal, and the situation has not changed significantly, we will hold a meeting to consider the possible termination of your employment. Before we make a decision, we will consider any matters you wish to raise and whether there have been any changes since the last meeting.
11. **Appeals**
    1. You may appeal against the outcome of any stage of this procedure. If you wish to appeal you should set out your appeal in writing to \[_insert name_], stating your grounds of appeal, within one week of the date on which the decision was sent or given to you.
    2. If you are appealing against a decision to dismiss you, we will hold an appeal meeting, normally within two weeks of receiving the appeal. This will be dealt with impartially and, where possible, by someone who has not previously been involved in the case.
    3. We will confirm our final decision in writing, usually within one week of the appeal hearing. There is no further right of appeal.
    4. The date that any dismissal takes effect will not be delayed pending the outcome of an appeal. However, if the appeal is successful, the decision to dismiss will be revoked with no loss of continuity or pay.

(Data Protection Policy)

1. **Interpretation**

**Automated Decision-Making (ADM):** when a decision is made which is based solely on Automated Processing (including profiling) which produces legal effects or significantly affects an individual. The UK GDPR prohibits Automated Decision-Making (unless certain conditions are met) but not Automated Processing.

**Automated Processing:** any form of automated processing of Personal Data consisting of the use of Personal Data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to an individual, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that individual's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements. Profiling is an example of Automated Processing.

**Company name:** The IO Foundation MTU.

**Company Personnel:** all employees, workers contractors, agency workers, consultants, directors, volunteers and others.

**Consent:** agreement which must be freely given, specific, informed and be an unambiguous indication of the Data Subject's wishes by which they, by a statement or by a clear positive action, signify agreement to the Processing of Personal Data relating to them.

**Controller:** the person or organisation that determines when, why and how to process Personal Data. It is responsible for establishing practices and policies in line with the UK GDPR. We are the Controller of all Personal Data relating to our Company Personnel and Personal Data used in our business for our own commercial purposes.

**Criminal Convictions Data**: means personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences and includes personal data relating to criminal allegations and proceedings.

**Data Subject:** a living, identified or identifiable individual about whom we hold Personal Data. Data Subjects may be nationals or residents of any country and may have legal rights regarding their Personal Data.

**Data Privacy Impact Assessment (DPIA):** tools and assessments used to identify and reduce risks of a data processing activity. DPIA can be carried out as part of Privacy by Design and should be conducted for all major system or business change programmes involving the Processing of Personal Data.

**Data Protection Officer (DPO):** the person required to be appointed in specific circumstances under the UK GDPR. Where a mandatory DPO has not been appointed, this term means a data protection manager or other voluntary appointment of a DPO or refers to the Company data privacy team with responsibility for data protection compliance.

**EEA:** the 28 countries in the EU, and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

**Explicit Consent:** consent which requires a very clear and specific statement (that is, not just action).

**UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):** the General Data Protection Regulation (_(EU) 2016/679_) as it forms part of the law of England and Wales by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. Personal Data is subject to the legal safeguards specified in the UK GDPR.

**Personal Data:** any information identifying a Data Subject or information relating to a Data Subject that we can identify (directly or indirectly) from that data alone or in combination with other identifiers we possess or can reasonably access. Personal Data includes Special Categories of Personal Data and Pseudonymised Personal Data but excludes anonymous data or data that has had the identity of an individual permanently removed. Personal data can be factual (for example, a name, email address, location or date of birth) or an opinion about that person's actions or behaviour.

**Personal Data Breach:** any act or omission that compromises the security, confidentiality, integrity or availability of Personal Data or the physical, technical, administrative or organisational safeguards that we or our third-party service providers put in place to protect it. The loss, or unauthorised access, disclosure or acquisition, of Personal Data is a Personal Data Breach.

**Privacy by Design:** implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures in an effective manner to ensure compliance with the UK GDPR.

**Privacy Notices (also referred to as Fair Processing Notices) or Privacy Policies:** separate notices setting out information that may be provided to Data Subjects when the Company collects information about them. These notices may take the form of general privacy statements applicable to a specific group of individuals (for example, employee privacy notices or the website privacy policy) or they may be stand-alone, one-time privacy statements covering Processing related to a specific purpose.

**Processing or Process:** any activity that involves the use of Personal Data. It includes obtaining, recording or holding the data, or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the data including organising, amending, retrieving, using, disclosing, erasing or destroying it. Processing also includes transmitting or transferring Personal Data to third parties.

**Pseudonymisation or Pseudonymised:** replacing information that directly or indirectly identifies an individual with one or more artificial identifiers or pseudonyms so that the person, to whom the data relates, cannot be identified without the use of additional information which is meant to be kept separately and secure.

**Special Categories of Personal Data:** information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or similar beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health conditions, sexual life, sexual orientation, biometric or genetic data, and Personal Data.

1. **INTRODUCTION**
   1. The Data Protection Policy sets out how The IO Foundation MTU ("we", "our", "us", "the Company") handle the Personal Data of our customers, suppliers, employees, workers and other third parties.
   2. This Data Protection Policy applies to all Personal Data we Process regardless of the media on which that data is stored or whether it relates to past or present employees, workers, customers, clients or supplier contacts, website users or any other Data Subject.
   3. This Data Protection Policy applies to all Company Personnel ("you", "your"). You must read, understand and comply with this Data Protection Policy when Processing Personal Data on our behalf and attend training on its requirements.

    8. if you need any assistance dealing with any rights invoked by a Data Subject (see paragraph 15);
    9. whenever you are engaging in a significant new, or change in, Processing activity which is likely to require a DPIA (see paragraph 19) or plan to use Personal Data for purposes other than what it was collected for;
    10. if you plan to undertake any activities involving Automated Processing including profiling or Automated Decision-Making (see paragraph 20);
    11. if you need help complying with applicable law when carrying out direct marketing activities (see paragraph 21); or
    12. if you need help with any contracts or other areas in relation to sharing Personal Data with third parties (including our vendors) (see paragraph 22).

1. **Personal data protection principles**
   1. We adhere to the principles relating to Processing of Personal Data set out in the UK GDPR which require Personal Data to be:
      1. processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner (Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency);
      2. collected only for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes (Purpose Limitation);
      3. adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is Processed (Data Minimisation);
      4. accurate and where necessary kept up to date (Accuracy);
      5. not kept in a form which permits identification of Data Subjects for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data is Processed (Storage Limitation);
      6. processed in a manner that ensures its security using appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect against unauthorised or unlawful Processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage (Security, Integrity and Confidentiality);
      7. not transferred to another country without appropriate safeguards being in place (Transfer Limitation); and
      8. made available to Data Subjects and allow Data Subjects to exercise certain rights in relation to their Personal Data (Data Subject's Rights and Requests).
   2. We are responsible for and must be able to demonstrate compliance with the data protection principles listed above (Accountability).
2. **Lawfulness, fairness, transparency**
   1. Personal data must be Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the Data Subject.
   2. You may only collect, Process and share Personal Data fairly and lawfully and for specified purposes. The UK GDPR restricts our actions regarding Personal Data to specified lawful purposes. These restrictions are not intended to prevent Processing, but ensure that we Process Personal Data fairly and without adversely affecting the Data Subject.
   3. The UK GDPR allows Processing for specific purposes, some of which are set out below:
      1. the Data Subject has given his or her Consent;
      2. the Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the Data Subject;
      3. to meet our legal compliance obligations;
      4. to protect the Data Subject's vital interests;
      5. to pursue our legitimate interests for purposes where they are not overridden because the Processing prejudices the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of Data Subjects. The purposes for which we process Personal Data for legitimate interests need to be set out in applicable Privacy Notices; or
      6. \[_insert other UK GDPR processing grounds_].
   4. You must identify and document the legal ground being relied on for each Processing activity in accordance with any Company guidelines on Lawful Basis for Processing Personal Data, in force from time to time.
3. **Consent**
   1. A Controller must only process Personal Data on the basis of one or more of the lawful bases set out in the UK GDPR, which include Consent.
   2. A Data Subject consents to Processing of their Personal Data if they indicate agreement clearly either by a statement or positive action to the Processing. Consent requires affirmative action so silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity are unlikely to be sufficient. If Consent is given in a document which deals with other matters, then the Consent must be kept separate from those other matters.
   3. Data Subjects must be easily able to withdraw Consent to Processing at any time and withdrawal must be promptly honoured. Consent may need to be refreshed if you intend to Process Personal Data for a different and incompatible purpose which was not disclosed when the Data Subject first consented.
   4. When processing Special Category Data or Criminal Convictions Data, we will usually rely on a legal basis for processing other than Explicit Consent or Consent if possible. Where Explicit Consent is relied on, you must issue a Privacy Notice to the Data Subject to capture Explicit Consent.
   5. You will need to evidence Consent captured and keep records of all Consents so that the Company can demonstrate compliance with Consent requirements.
4. **Transparency (notifying Data Subjects)**
   1. The UK GDPR requires Data Controllers to provide detailed, specific information to Data Subjects depending on whether the information was collected directly from Data Subjects or from elsewhere. The information must be provided through appropriate Privacy Notices which must be concise, transparent, intelligible, easily accessible, and in clear and plain language so that a Data Subject can easily understand them.
   2. Whenever we collect Personal Data directly from Data Subjects, including for human resources or employment purposes, we must provide the Data Subject with all the information required by the UK GDPR including the identity of the Controller and DPO, how and why we will use, Process, disclose, protect and retain that Personal Data through a Privacy Notice which must be presented when the Data Subject first provides the Personal Data.
   3. When Personal Data is collected indirectly (for example, from a third party or publicly available source), we must provide the Data Subject with all the information required by the UK GDPR as soon as possible after collecting or receiving the data. We must also check that the Personal Data was collected by the third party in accordance with the UK GDPR and on a basis which contemplates our proposed Processing of that Personal Data.
   4. If you are collecting Personal Data from Data Subjects, directly or indirectly, then you must provide Data Subjects with a Privacy Notice.
   5. You must comply with any Company guidelines on drafting Privacy Notices, in force from time to time.
5. **Purpose limitation**
   1. Personal Data must be collected only for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes. It must not be further Processed in any manner incompatible with those purposes.
   2. You cannot use Personal Data for new, different or incompatible purposes from that disclosed when it was first obtained unless you have informed the Data Subject of the new purposes and they have provided Consent where necessary.
6. **Data minimisation**
   1. Personal Data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is Processed.
   2. You may only Process Personal Data when performing your job duties requires it. You cannot Process Personal Data for any reason unrelated to your job duties.
   3. You may only collect Personal Data that you require for your job duties: do not collect excessive data. Ensure any Personal Data collected is adequate and relevant for the intended purposes.
   4. You must ensure that when Personal Data is no longer needed for specified purposes, it is deleted or anonymised in accordance with the Company's data retention guidelines.
7. **Accuracy**
   1. Personal Data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. It must be corrected or deleted without delay when inaccurate.
   2. You will ensure that the Personal Data we use and hold is accurate, complete, kept up to date and relevant to the purpose for which we collected it. You must check the accuracy of any Personal Data at the point of collection and at regular intervals afterwards. You must take all reasonable steps to destroy or amend inaccurate or out-of-date Personal Data.
8. **Storage limitation**
   1. Personal Data must not be kept in an identifiable form for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data is processed.
   2. The Company will maintain retention policies and procedures to ensure Personal Data is deleted after a reasonable time for the purposes for which it was being held, unless a law requires that data to be kept for a minimum time. You must comply with any Company guidelines on data retention in force from time to time.
   3. You must not keep Personal Data in a form which permits the identification of the Data Subject for longer than needed for the legitimate business purpose or purposes for which we originally collected it including for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.
   4. You will take all reasonable steps to destroy or erase from our systems all Personal Data that we no longer require in accordance with all the Company's applicable records retention schedules and policies. This includes requiring third parties to delete that data where applicable.
   5. You will ensure Data Subjects are informed of the period for which data is stored and how that period is determined in any applicable Privacy Notice.
9. **Security integrity and confidentiality**
   1. Personal Data must be secured by appropriate technical and organisational measures against unauthorised or unlawful Processing, and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.
   2. We will develop, implement and maintain safeguards appropriate to our size, scope and business, our available resources, the amount of Personal Data that we own or maintain on behalf of others and identified risks (including use of encryption and Pseudonymisation where applicable). We will regularly evaluate and test the effectiveness of those safeguards to ensure security of our Processing of Personal Data. You are responsible for protecting the Personal Data we hold. You must implement reasonable and appropriate security measures against unlawful or unauthorised Processing of Personal Data and against the accidental loss of, or damage to, Personal Data. You must exercise particular care in protecting Special Categories of Personal Data and Criminal Convictions Data from loss and unauthorised access, use or disclosure.
   3. You must follow all procedures and technologies we put in place to maintain the security of all Personal Data from the point of collection to the point of destruction. You may only transfer Personal Data to third-party service providers who agree to comply with the required policies and procedures and who agree to put adequate measures in place, as requested.
   4. You must maintain data security by protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Personal Data, defined as follows:
      1. Confidentiality means that only people who have a need to know and are authorised to use the Personal Data can access it;
      2. Integrity means that Personal Data is accurate and suitable for the purpose for which it is processed; and
      3. Availability means that authorised users are able to access the Personal Data when they need it for authorised purposes.
   5. You must comply with and not attempt to circumvent the administrative, physical and technical safeguards we implement and maintain in accordance with the UK GDPR and relevant standards to protect Personal Data.
10. **Reporting a Personal Data Breach**
    1. The UK GDPR requires Controllers to notify any Personal Data Breach to the applicable regulator and, in certain instances, the Data Subject.
    2. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data Breach and will notify Data Subjects or any applicable regulator where we are legally required to do so.
    3. If you know or suspect that a Personal Data Breach has occurred, do not attempt to investigate the matter yourself. Immediately contact the DPO. You should preserve all evidence relating to the potential Personal Data Breach.
11. **Transfer limitation**
    1. The UK GDPR restricts data transfers to countries outside the EEA to ensure that the level of data protection afforded to individuals by the UK GDPR is not undermined. You transfer Personal Data originating in one country across borders when you transmit, send, view or access that data in or to a different country.
    2. You may only transfer Personal Data outside the EEA if one of the following conditions applies:
       1. the European Commission has issued a decision confirming that the country to which we transfer the Personal Data ensures an adequate level of protection for the Data Subject's rights and freedoms;
       2. appropriate safeguards are in place such as binding corporate rules (BCR), standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, an approved code of conduct or a certification mechanism, a copy of which can be obtained from the DPO;
       3. the Data Subject has provided Explicit Consent to the proposed transfer after being informed of any potential risks; or
       4. the transfer is necessary for one of the other reasons set out in the UK GDPR including the performance of a contract between us and the Data Subject, reasons of public interest, to establish, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject where the Data Subject is physically or legally incapable of giving Consent and, in some limited cases, for our legitimate interest.
    3. You must comply with any Company guidelines on cross-border data transfers in force from time to time.
12. **Data Subject's rights and requests**
    1. Data Subjects have rights when it comes to how we handle their Personal Data. These include rights to:
       1. withdraw Consent to Processing at any time;
       2. receive certain information about the Data Controller's Processing activities;
       3. request access to their Personal Data that we hold;
       4. prevent our use of their Personal Data for direct marketing purposes;
       5. ask us to erase Personal Data if it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or Processed or to rectify inaccurate data or to complete incomplete data;
       6. restrict Processing in specific circumstances;
       7. challenge Processing which has been justified on the basis of our legitimate interests or in the public interest;
       8. request a copy of an agreement under which Personal Data is transferred outside of the EEA;

       12. make a complaint to the supervisory authority; and
       13. in limited circumstances, receive or ask for their Personal Data to be transferred to a third party in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
    2. You must verify the identity of an individual requesting data under any of the rights listed above (do not allow third parties to persuade you into disclosing Personal Data without proper authorisation).
    3. You must immediately forward any Data Subject request you receive to DPO and comply with any Company Data Subject response process in force from time to time.
13. **Accountability**
    1. The Controller must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in an effective manner, to ensure compliance with data protection principles. The Controller is responsible for, and must be able to demonstrate, compliance with the data protection principles.
    2. The Company must have adequate resources and controls in place to ensure and to document UK GDPR compliance including:
       1. appointing a suitably qualified DPO (where necessary) and an executive accountable for data privacy;
       2. implementing Privacy by Design when Processing Personal Data and completing DPIAs where Processing presents a high risk to rights and freedoms of Data Subjects;

integrating data protection into internal documents including this Data Protection Policy or Privacy Notices;

regularly training Company Personnel on the UK GDPR, this Data Protection Policy and data protection matters including, for example, Data Subject's rights, Consent, legal bases, DPIA and Personal Data Breaches. The Company must maintain a record of training attendance by Company Personnel; and

   2. You must keep and maintain accurate corporate records reflecting our Processing including records of Data Subjects' Consents and procedures for obtaining Consents in accordance with any Company record-keeping guidelines in force from time to time.
   3. These records should include, at a minimum, the name and contact details of the Controller and the DPO, clear descriptions of the Personal Data types, Data Subject types, Processing activities, Processing purposes, third-party recipients of the Personal Data, Personal Data storage locations, Personal Data transfers, the Personal Data's retention period and a description of the security measures in place. To create the records, data maps should be created which should include the detail set out above together with appropriate data flows.

1. **Privacy By Design and Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)**
   1. We are required to implement Privacy by Design measures when Processing Personal Data by implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures (like Pseudonymisation) in an effective manner, to ensure compliance with data privacy principles.
   2. You must assess what Privacy by Design measures can be implemented on all programmes, systems or processes that Process Personal Data by taking into account the following:
      1. the state of the art;
      2. the cost of implementation;
      3. the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing; and
      4. the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of Data Subjects posed by the Processing.
   3. Data controllers must also conduct DPIAs in respect to high-risk Processing.
   4. You should conduct a DPIA (and discuss your findings with the DPO) when implementing major system or business change programs involving the Processing of Personal Data including:
      1. use of new technologies (programs, systems or processes), or changing technologies (programs, systems or processes);
      2. automated Processing including profiling and ADM;
      3. large-scale Processing of Special Categories of Personal Data or Criminal Convictions Data; and
      4. large scale, systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area.
   5. A DPIA must include:
      1. a description of the Processing, its purposes and the Data Controller's legitimate interests if appropriate;
      2. an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the Processing in relation to its purpose;
      3. an assessment of the risk to individuals; and
      4. the risk mitigation measures in place and demonstration of compliance.

You must comply with any Company guidelines on DPIA and Privacy by Design in force from time to time.

1. **Automated Processing (including profiling) and Automated Decision-Making**
   1. Generally, ADM is prohibited when a decision has a legal or similar significant effect on an individual unless:
      1. a Data Subject has given Explicit Consent;
      2. the Processing is authorised by law; or
      3. the Processing is necessary for the performance of or entering into a contract.
   2. If certain types of Special Categories of Personal Data or Criminal Convictions Data are being processed, then grounds (b) or (c) will not be allowed but the Special Categories of Personal Data and Criminal Convictions Data can be Processed where it is necessary (unless less intrusive means can be used) for substantial public interest like fraud prevention.
   3. If a decision is to be based solely on Automated Processing (including profiling), then Data Subjects must be informed when you first communicate with them of their right to object. This right must be explicitly brought to their attention and presented clearly and separately from other information. Further, suitable measures must be put in place to safeguard the Data Subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests.
   4. We must also inform the Data Subject of the logic involved in the decision making or profiling, the significance and envisaged consequences and give the Data Subject the right to request human intervention, express their point of view or challenge the decision.
   5. A DPIA must be carried out before any Automated Processing (including profiling) or ADM activities are undertaken.
   6. Where you are involved in any data Processing activity that involves profiling or ADM, you must comply with any Company guidelines on profiling or ADM in force from time to time.
2. **Direct marketing**
   1. We are subject to certain rules and privacy laws when marketing to our customers.
   2. For example, a Data Subject's prior consent is required for electronic direct marketing (for example, by email, text or automated calls). The limited exception for existing customers known as "soft opt in" allows organisations to send marketing texts or emails if they have obtained contact details in the course of a sale to that person, they are marketing similar products or services, and they gave the person an opportunity to opt out of marketing when first collecting the details and in every subsequent message.
   3. The right to object to direct marketing must be explicitly offered to the Data Subject in an intelligible manner so that it is clearly distinguishable from other information.
   4. A Data Subject's objection to direct marketing must be promptly honoured. If a customer opts out at any time, their details should be suppressed as soon as possible. Suppression involves retaining just enough information to ensure that marketing preferences are respected in the future.
   5. You must comply with any Company guidelines on direct marketing to customers in force from time to time.
3. **Sharing Personal Data**
   1. Generally we are not allowed to share Personal Data with third parties unless certain safeguards and contractual arrangements have been put in place.
   2. You may only share the Personal Data we hold with another employee, agent or representative of our group (which includes our subsidiaries and our ultimate holding company along with its subsidiaries) if the recipient has a job-related need to know the information and the transfer complies with any applicable cross-border transfer restrictions.
   3. You may only share the Personal Data we hold with third parties if:
      1. they have a need to know the information for the purposes of providing the contracted services;
      2. sharing the Personal Data complies with the Privacy Notice provided to the Data Subject and, if required, the Data Subject's Consent has been obtained;
      3. the third party has agreed to comply with the required data security standards, policies and procedures and put adequate security measures in place;
      4. the transfer complies with any applicable cross border transfer restrictions; and
      5. a fully executed written contract that contains UK GDPR-approved third party clauses has been obtained.
   4. You must comply with any Company guidelines on sharing data with third parties in force from time to time.
4. **Changes to this Data Protection Policy**

We keep this Data Protection Policy under regular review. This version was last updated in \[January] 2021.

This Data Protection Policy does not override any applicable national data privacy laws and regulations in countries where the Company operates.

1. **About this policy**
   1. Our IT and communications systems are intended to promote effective communication and working practices. This policy outlines the standards you must observe when using these systems, when we will monitor their use, and the action we will take if you breach these standards.
   2. Breach of this policy may be dealt with under our Disciplinary Procedure and, in serious cases, may be treated as gross misconduct leading to summary dismissal.
   3. This policy does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.
2. **Equipment security and passwords**
   1. You are responsible for the security of the equipment allocated to or used by you, and you must not allow it to be used by anyone other than in accordance with this policy. You should use passwords on all IT equipment, particularly items that you take out of the office. You should keep your passwords confidential and change them regularly.
   2. You must only log on to our systems using your own username and password. You must not use another person's username and password or allow anyone else to log on using your username and password.
   3. If you are away from your desk you should log out or lock your computer. You must log out and shut down your computer at the end of each working day.
3. **Systems and data security**
   1. You should not delete, destroy or modify existing systems, programs, information or data (except as authorised in the proper performance of your duties).
   2. You must not download or install software from external sources without authorisation. Downloading unauthorised software may interfere with our systems and may introduce viruses or other malware.
   3. You must not attach any device or equipment including mobile phones, tablet computers or USB storage devices to our systems without authorisation.
   4. We monitor all e-mails passing through our system for viruses. You should exercise particular caution when opening unsolicited e-mails from unknown sources. If an e-mail looks suspicious do not reply to it, open any attachments or click any links in it.
   5. Inform someone immediately if you suspect your computer may have a virus.
4. **E-mail**
   1. Adopt a professional tone and observe appropriate etiquette when communicating with third parties by e-mail.
   2. Remember that e-mails can be used in legal proceedings and that even deleted e-mails may remain on the system and be capable of being retrieved.
   3. You must not send abusive, obscene, discriminatory, racist, harassing, derogatory, defamatory, pornographic or otherwise inappropriate e-mails.
   4. You should not:
      1. send or forward private e-mails at work which you would not want a third party to read;
      2. send or forward chain mail, junk mail, cartoons, jokes or gossip;
      3. contribute to system congestion by sending trivial messages or unnecessarily copying or forwarding e-mails to others who do not have a real need to receive them; or
      4. send messages from another person's e-mail address (unless authorised) or under an assumed name.
   5. Do not use your own personal e-mail account to send or receive e-mail for the purposes of our business. Only use the e-mail account we have provided for you.
   6. \[We do not permit access to web-based personal e-mail such as Gmail or Hotmail on our computer systems at any time due to additional security risks.]

   2. You should not access any web page or download any image or other file from the internet which could be regarded as illegal, offensive, in bad taste or immoral. Even web content that is legal in the UK may be in sufficient bad taste to fall within this prohibition. As a general rule, if any person (whether intended to view the page or not) might be offended by the contents of a page, or if the fact that our software has accessed the page or file might be a source of embarrassment if made public, then viewing it will be a breach of this policy.
   3. We may block or restrict access to some websites at our discretion.
6. **Personal use of our systems**
   1. We permit the incidental use of our systems to send personal e-mail, browse the internet and make personal telephone calls subject to certain conditions. Personal use is a privilege and not a right. It must not be overused or abused. We may withdraw permission for it at any time or restrict access at our discretion.
   2. Personal use must meet the following conditions:
      1. it must be minimal and take place \[substantially **OR** exclusively] outside of normal working hours (that is, during your lunch break, and before or after work);
      2. it must not affect your work or interfere with the business;
      3. it must not commit us to any marginal costs; and
      4. it must comply with our policies including the Equal Opportunities Policy, Anti-harassment and Bullying Policy, Data Protection Policy and Disciplinary Procedure.

For business reasons, and in order to carry out legal obligations in our role as an employer, your use of our systems including the telephone and computer systems (including any personal use) may be continually monitored by automated software or otherwise.
   2. We reserve the right to retrieve the contents of e-mail messages or check internet usage (including pages visited and searches made) as reasonably necessary in the interests of the business, including for the following purposes (this list is not exhaustive):
