An organization dedicated to oversee, protect and enforce Digital Rights.

Introduction:

**OPTION**:

The IO Foundation, or TIOF in short, is a nonprofit registered in Estonia with operational offices in Malaysia and the Philippines.

The organization’s primary goal is to advocate for the proclamation of a Universal Declaration of Human Rights with the clear objective of preserving Human Rights as communities become more and more digital.

To this end, we are developing programs that will help raise awareness among communities on the importance of their Digital Rights as well as actions to provide tools that will assist them.

We aim to embark both civil society and bodies of governance in this fundamental change that we seek to achieve.

If our objectives resonate with you, reach out to us!

Established in Estonia, TIOF has presence in several locations (see Contact Us).

That comes into the picture that I am envisioning the Foundation as a more generic entity:

That allows us to do training, to host 1Persona, to push for it, to have that interactive map and such. And to even push for the Crypto Fund.

He would be charged of searching the necessary data, we would create the framework and he would maintain it (he has a team, apparently).

They would also search for funding for the map and thus for the Foundation.

Text for messaging:

The goal of the Foundation is to promote, raise awareness and help people protect their Digital Rights.

I have 4 projects that are gonna be under the organization, as we speak.

One is an Open Source sorftware platform, another one a community development project , another is a map for Digital Rights and the last one is a platform for financial transparency in NGOs (for donors and grants and whatnot).

give training, digital security and whatnot

It was really great meeting you at the TechTarik event last Friday. It was great to see your enthusiasm when you shared your observations regarding the need to bridge lawmakers with stakeholders in tech.

I introduced TIOF briefly at the session and as we talked a little bit after, I promised you an email explaining what we do in better detail. Here it is.

TIOF - www.theiofoundation.org - is an international non-profit organization working towards the application of human rights in digital spaces or digital rights. While registered in Estonia, the organization was conceptualized and founded in Asia, specifically the Philippines. We initially came from the environment of humanitarian work and as we dig deeper into developing digital tools for effective and efficient humanitarian response, we realized our vision responds more into human rights and specifically human rights in the evolving digital environment. Our world is changing and as society evolves even more advanced due to the influx of information technology development, more and more, we are entering an era where everything becomes new again and we are caught in the space where new social constructs need to be looked into to respond to the growing variations of society. TIOF wishes to respond to these growth and provide an environment where solutions can be discussed ahead rather than later in time.

Our programs are summed up into three categories: awareness, engagement and strategic. Awareness programs are mostly focused on raising consciousness on digital rights and other aspects surrounding it while engagement programs are programs that provide solutions to certain problems. Right now, we are engaged in two main activities in Malaysia which I would like to reach out to you for possible collaborations. The first is TechUp which is a monthly one-day workshop that links up tech companies or tech individuals to civil society. The other one is BHR or Business and Human Rights which is an international project to increase awareness of the UNGP on BHR, with focus on tech. I'll be happy to introduce you to my colleague @Isaac Adams to give you more input on TechUp while I wish to go deeper on BHR in this email and request your collaboration.

The BHR in the Tech Sector project we implement in Malaysia is part of a global BHR in Tech project implemented in 7 other countries and in partnership with Global Partners Digital, Ranking Digital Rights, Internews Network and Open Technology Institute. Specifically, the project aims to make CSOs aware of BHR specifically its implementation in the Tech Sector. Countries signing on the UNGP, Malaysia included, committed to the passage of a National Action Plan on BHR. We hope to complement this work by providing a venue for understanding specifically with civil society organizations. It is in this regard that I reach out to invite you to participate in our upcoming Introduction to BHR session on Saturday, 25 May 2019. During which we hope to facilitate a round-table discourse with other CSOs about BHR and how we could work together and move onwards.

Cases of data manipulation and exploitation are commonplace, nowadays. These events erode the thin trust of users in digital services, forcing governments to find creative solutions to deal with technologies that are more often than not complex and difficult to regulate with traditional tools. Regulating at policy level has shown to not be enough. Being able to create trust in consumers and build a sustainable digital economy requires instead implementing an infrastructure for data protection and digital identities management through effective technical standards with supporting national policies.

For instance, PDPA provides a legal framework to protect users' data by setting the rules of their usage in legal terms. However, PDPA does not establish the technical requirements necessary to ensure their implementation in digital services.

As an analogy, this would be equivalent to have a regulation on potable tap water without providing the necessary technical description on how to treat water so that it is effectively potable.

This new approach requires of the awareness of a number of national stakeholders, which will be engaged through the Conference.

Conference: A National approach on Digital Rights.

Multistakeholder Focus Groups:

Oriented to create awareness, analyze and find possible solutions to Digital Rights from a technical standard perspective.

Seminar: Building a National Alliance on Digital Rights.

This event aims to gather different national stakeholders to build a National Framework for Digital Rights.

Masterclasses:

Training for MCMC members on topics related to Digital Rights.

TechUp:

Training for local tech community on technologies related to Digital Rights.
