# 👍 About The IO Foundation

The IO Foundation (TIOF) is a for-impact NGO advocating for [Data-Centric Digital Rights (DCDR)](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy) to establish a more solid approach from a technical standards perspective into digital spaces and to raise awareness on the critical role of programmers as the Next Generation of Rights defenders.



The IO Foundation (TIOF) is a global for-impact NGO born from a fundamental concern about the state of technology in the world and advocating for Data-Centric Digital Rights.

As data becomes an increasingly powerful economic, political and social force, _programmers are emerging as the Next Generation of Rights defenders_. There remains, however, a limited international understanding of the impact of technology on citizens and their digital twins.



Following its vision of _a world where Human Rights and Data-Centric Digital Rights are one and the same_, TIOF aims to raise awareness of the importance of Data-Centric Digital Rights in collaboration with all stakeholders ranging from civil society, programmer communities, bodies of governance and corporate.

, its mission is to promote, _protect and provide solutions for Digital Rights_, thus aiming to bridge technological and humanitarian perspectives.
