# 👍 About The IO Foundation

## The organization

The IO Foundation (TIOF) is a global for-impact NGO born from a fundamental concern about the state of technology in the world and advocating for [Data-Centric Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy).

As societies become inevitably digital, _their architects and builders need to embrace their fundamental role as the_ [_Next Generation of Rights defenders_](https://tiof.click/TIOFNextGen).

There remains, however, a limited international understanding of the true impact of technology on citizens and their digital twins as data becomes an increasingly powerful economic, political and social force.

TIOF aims to raise awareness of the importance of [Data-Centric Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy) in collaboration with all stakeholders ranging from civil society, programmer communities, bodies of governance and corporate and work together to achieve the proclamation and adoption of a Universal Declaration of Digital Rights.



### Mission
