## About





## Lead Generation

The IO Foundation requires interacting with a number of potential stakeholders and reach out to potential beneficiaries in order to further its advocacy, otherwise known as leads.

Obtaining these leads can be done through a number of methods.

The IO Foundation has a clear policy of not generating leads by methods that infringe this Policy.
