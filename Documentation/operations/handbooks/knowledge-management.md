{% endhint %}



## Purpose

\


This process document explains the file naming conventions for documents and  media.&#x20;

## Principal User

This document is used by all members of the TIOF organization when creating documents, setting them up for review, and storing them for access by teams or the entire organization.&#x20;

\


This document is also to be used by project members when naming project files.

\


All files in the organization are to follow the standard file naming conventions.

## Scope

This policy only applies to TIOF files created after the date of approval at the end of this document. A retroactive application of this policy may be implemented for existing documents, as necessary, in the future.

\


This document applies to internal TIOF files at the foundation level and at the project level.&#x20;

\


This document does not apply to or cover the naming of shared drives. Standard names for shared drives are covered in a separate document.

\


## File Naming Convention for Files

### Naming Format

The formatting for a file name, at TIOF level or project level, is as follows, with the optional parts in grey.



\[ORG INITIATIVE]  Team \[Privacy Level]  {DATE} {Organization Label} {Document Identifier} Content {Content Parameters} Language  Version {SIGNED}.extension

Notes to evaluate

Prior to a document being finalized and stored, you can use version names&#x20;

in the filename to indicate where the document is in the development cycle. Use these lifecycle indicators with the version number.

v0.1 In Progress (or IP - for a document in an early or late draft stage)

v0.1 In Review  (or IR - for a document people are reviewing or commenting on)

v1.0 Routing (meaning routing for approval/signature)

\










#### Content&#x20;

&#x20;&#x20;

For all files, the title must reflect and include the name of a standard type of file used in the organization. Standard file types, including standard documents used in TIOF, are stored in an approved list. See your manager/coordinator to access the approved list.&#x20;

\


**Team Finance**



| Value                      | Usage | Charter of Accounts Code |
| -------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------ |
| Invoice                    |       |                          |
| Payment                    |       |                          |
| Debtor Statement           |       |                          |
| Loan to {TIOF Member Code} |       |                          |
| Quotation                  |       |                          |
| Sales Receipt              |       |                          |
| Bill                       |       |                          |
| Bank Statement             |       |                          |
| Bank Statement Scan Page   |       |                          |
| Debit Advice Scan          |       |                          |
| Debit Advice Scan Page     |       |                          |



Important considerations:

When scanned together, Invoice and Receipts are to be duplicated at file level. When paid together (which is not encouraged), each invoice is to be duplicated at file level.

Examples







**Team UXUI**

The file naming format is the same for images except the following must be added, altogether in one set of brackets and separated by dashes, after the title: Image Type, Color Scheme, Transparency, Size.&#x20;

\


Note: The department code for images should always be Comms for Communications.

Example: \[TIOF] COMMS \[P] Sharon Smith ProfilePic \[C-BW-T-S]  XXX v1.0.jpg

#### Image Type: &#x20;

* SQ (Square)
* Hex (Hexagonal)
* C (Circular)

#### Color Scheme

* FC for TIOF Full Color Scheme&#x20;
* BW for Black\&White

#### Transparency

* T for transparent&#x20;
* NT for Not Transparent&#x20;

#### Size

* Small (equal to or smaller than 300 X 400 pixels)
* Medium (between 300 X 400 and 600 X 800 pixels)
* Large (greater than 600 X 800 pixels)





### Examples

\[TIOF DCDR] Research \[I] Research Procedure ENG v1.0

\[TIOF  PLD] UXUI \[I] UI Element Specification ENG v1.5

\[TIOF PLD \[P] Operational Framework Diagram ENG v1.0

\[TIOF PLD] Devs \[I] Sys Architecture Diagram XXX v1.3   &#x20;

\[TIOF BiT] Finance \[I] GPD for Evidence Survey in Malaysia Invoice ENG v1.0

\[TIOF] ORG \[C] Certification for Benevity ENG v1.0

### Versioning

How to Version Up a Final Document

* Increase the decimal point (use a fractional number) for new documents in which changes were minimal or not of great importance.
* Go to the next whole number for new versions that have a great number of changes or changes of significant impact
* For the TIOF-level regulated (governing) documents (policies, processes, SOPs) , the final version numbering is determined by the Regulated Documents Coordinator.&#x20;
* For project-level regulated documents (policies, processes, SOPs) and all managed documents (at any level), reference the current document to know how to version up.&#x20;

Note: For marketing and other publicity materials, such as brochures, consider leaving off the version number but adding the year in the optional date position.





### Signing documents

Refer to eSignature the procedure to eSign a document.

If a document requires a signature, add the word SIGNED at the end of the document after the document has been reviewed and electronically signed.



### Extensions

#### .Ext (Extension - Automatically Applied)

The file extension is automatically added to the file by the application in which it is created. The file extension indicates the file type. Only certain file types are allowed to be used within the organization.

**Acceptable File Types:** &#x20;

\>> Make a taxonomy of accepted file extensions

See your manager, coordinator, or other TIOF executive for a list of acceptable file types.&#x20;



The list of file types that are acceptable is not necessarily inclusive. But anything that is not on the list of acceptable files must not be used without prior permission of a TIOF director.

\










### Limitations

This approach is not devoid of limitations that need to be kept in mind:

* The managing file system must allow long file naming
* Certain characters may be not allowed in certain platforms (Windows has limitations, for instance)
* The UI of the platform may truncate the filename and make it difficult to establish the context and content of the file.

All these limitations are understood and accepted by TIOF and dealt in the best of possible ways, such as providing its members with tools that minimize them.



### General Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts for File Naming&#x20;

1. Use initial caps to name documents and delimit words in a file name.

Correct: TIOF Core Branding Guidelines&#x20;

Incorrect: TIOF code branding guidelines

2. Do not use underscores. They can make it harder to locate files&#x20;
3. Wherever a code/acronym is used, it should appear in all caps
4. Keep file names short but meaningful and leave out articles such as ‚Äúthe,‚Äù ‚Äúa,‚Äù ‚Äúand,‚Äù etc.

Correct: PLD TopAccounts 2019

Incorrect: PLD Y 2019 The Top 100 Accounts Sales Data market share report

5. Dates, if used, should be at the beginning of the file name and must always be in the international date format: YYYYMMDD
6. Do not use these characters in a file name. They can cause problems with opening files, especially if the file is sent outside the organization.

Backslash:  \\&#x20;

Forward slash:  /&#x20;

Underscore:   \_\_

Bar/Sidebar: |&#x20;

Ampersand: \*&#x20;

Question mark: ?

Chevron brackets: <  >&#x20;

Financial symbols: ¬£ or $
