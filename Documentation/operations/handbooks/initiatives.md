## Project Organization

### General considerations

### Milestones

Projects in TIOF use Milestones to establish relevant deadlines in order to structure their implementation.

Milestones are created and maintained by:

* TIOF Management
* Project Managers

Milestones are organized in 2 levels:

* Organization-wide These Milestones apply across all the organization and are to be observed mainly by TIOF's organization core as well as Project Managers.
* Project-wide These Milestones apply specifically to a given TIOF Project and are to be observed by all Project's Teams.

### GitHub Issues

* Templates
* Labels
* Pinned Issues

When creating a new Feature

* Create a Root Issue
* List all subtasks as Tasks Markdown)
* Create the necessary Issues for each task and populate them with the necessary information as per template.
* Add the Issue # to the Root Issue (@@@ Look into automating this. Should be doable.)
