## Formatting

### Enunciations

When listing a number of items in a sequence, avoid using a coma (,) before the last one.

> Example
>
> Preferred: Tom, Luisa and Jenny when to first to the mountain, then to buy ice cream and finall back home.

### Lists

When listing a series of items, do not end them with punctuation unless it's a question.\
As a general rule, try to avoid exclamation marks.

> Example
>
> * This is one item
> * This another item
> * Maybe this would be a third item?
> * I am sure this is the fourth!
