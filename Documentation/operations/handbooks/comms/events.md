## Events

### Your event profile

As a representative of Project Lockdown, Members enjoy the opportunity to participate in events. We do this through sessions in which we participate as well as events that we organize ourselves. This comes with the unavoidable responsibility of behaving in a way that respects the TIOF Internal Code of Conduct and also to “label” themselves adequately.

\


The following are nomenclature guidelines to follow by all Members participating in an event while representing Project Lockdown.

\


Name

\[TIOF PLD] {Name}

\


Title/Position

Indicate your position in the organization or project team.

For instance:&#x20;

Organization naming

Project Lockdown: Using data to assess the impact on human and digital rights as a result of Covid-19 related Government measures

\


Abstract:

Human and digital rights have been greatly impacted by the various Covid-19 related measures that governments around the globe have implemented. Project Lockdown provides a mapping platform and an open API to explore and better understand the effects on people's rights within a territory, and importantly across territories over time. This panel discussion explores the deep ramifications of government policies across populations, the differences and anomalies in implementations and how our tools provide precise, time-sensitive snapshots that can be used for advocacy and awareness-raising, and ultimately to hold government policy makers to account. In relation to human and digital rights, we will identify positive deviants and contrast the often stringent sudden 'lockdown' measures with the gradual phased approach to easing of measures, and subsequent knee-jerk re-implementations.

Stimulating citizen awareness and action for rights during a global crisis

\


Format: Workshop

Language: English

Duration: 90 minutes

Presenters:

1. Ruha Thurairatnam (Project Manager)
2. Julie Green (Research Coordinator)
3. Jean F. Queralt (Global Coordinator)

\


Proposal:&#x20;

The speakers will present Project Lockdown’s mapping platform and how to use it and will share demos of future developments and features. We will also take some time to hear from the audience and to discuss strategies for how you might use the platform, and what you might want from the platform to support your own work.&#x20;

\


Objective:&#x20;

We hope to offer our curated data on government measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic for use by human rights and media organizations in the region. We would also like to explore potential collaborations with organizations in the region to further develop a dataset layer on contact-tracing apps and digital surveillance.
