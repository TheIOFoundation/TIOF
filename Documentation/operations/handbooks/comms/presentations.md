## Slide Repositories

Each Organization and Initiative has their own Slides Repository





## Creating your Presentation

### Storing and Document Nomenclature



## Access Level



## Structure of Presentations

A Presentation will be composed of 2 types of Slides

* Repository Slides
* Ad-hoc Slides



### Repository Slides

These are commonly used Slides that are templated to ensure consistency in image and messaging.

{% hint style="danger" %}
These Slides can only be edited in the corresponding Slide Repository by

* \[TIOF] Team UXUI > Design
* \[TIOF] Team Comms > Content
{% endhint %}

&#x20;

### Ad-hoc Slides

These are Slides that are specific for a given presentation and have little-to-no utility to be used as templates in the future.

## Designing the Presentation

Ask yourself the following questions:



## Creating the Presentation

* Create a new Presentation (follow above for where and how to name it)
* Visit the Slides Repo
* Find the Slide that you need
* Copy the Slide and Paste it in your new Presentation
* A prompt will appear - Select Link

{% hint style="info" %}
What happens if I can't find a Slide that I need?

Ask \[TIOF] Team UXUI to create one for you.
