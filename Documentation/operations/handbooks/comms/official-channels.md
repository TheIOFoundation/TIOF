### Descriptions

The IO Foundation (TIOF) is a global for-impact NGO advocating for Data-Centric Digital Rights. Born from a fundamental concern about the state of Digital Rights in the world, its mission is to promote, protect and provide solutions for Digital Rights, thus aiming to bridge technological and humanitarian perspectives. As data becomes an increasingly powerful economic, political, and social force, programmers are emerging as the next generation of Human and Digital Rights defenders. Following its vision of a world where Human Rights and Digital Rights are one and the same, TIOF aims to raise awareness of the importance of Digital Rights in collaboration with other organizations, both from civil society and bodies of governance.
