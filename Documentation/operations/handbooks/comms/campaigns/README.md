### Defining new Campaigns

If a new type of Campaign is deemed necessary, it can be requested through the [Requisition Platform](https://tiof.click/TIOFTarianRequisitionService).

Approval and implementation will be discussed primarily during the yearly [Strat Meet](../../../meetings/strat-meets.md).\
Should there be any emergency, if can be requested to be discussed during an upcoming [Status Call](../../../meetings/status-calls.md).

Training will be implemented as soon as the Campaign and its materials are ready.&#x20;

## Campaign Templates

Standardized materials to execute the Campaigns are available in the repository.

Follow the instructions in each Campaign's SOP.
