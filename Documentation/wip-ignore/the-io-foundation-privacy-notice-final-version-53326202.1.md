**Volunteer Privacy Notice (UK)**

**About this Notice**

This Volunteer Privacy Notice applies to UK based volunteers and prospective volunteers of The IO Foundation MTU (the "**Foundation**", "**we" or "us**").

We are required under data protection legislation to notify you of the information contained in this Privacy Notice.

The Foundation is a "data controller" in relation to your personal data and for some purposes, also a "data processor". This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal information about you.

We value the privacy of those who provide personal information to us. **Please read this Privacy Notice carefully to understand how we handle your personal information.** This Privacy Notice describes:

#### what personal information we collect about our UK-based volunteers and potential volunteers;

#### how we use and otherwise process it;

#### the basis upon which we process it;

#### with whom it is shared; and

#### how it is stored.

This notice also describes other important topics relating to information privacy.

### Who does this notice apply to? <a href="#_toc514706664" id="_toc514706664"></a>

#### This Privacy Notice applies to all volunteers and prospective volunteers of the Foundation who are based in the UK. It does not apply to volunteers and prospective volunteers outside the UK.

#### It applies to all of your personal data that we process in the context of your engagement or prospective engagement in the UK.

### Data protection principles <a href="#_toc514706665" id="_toc514706665"></a>

We will comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws. These provide that the personal data we hold about you must be:

**used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way;**

**collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes;**

**relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited only to those purposes;**

**accurate and kept up to date;**

**kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about; and**

**kept securely.**

### The information that we hold about you <a href="#_toc513495085" id="_toc513495085"></a>

#### Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data which cannot be linked to an individual in any way (i.e. anonymous data).

#### There are "special categories" of more sensitive personal data which require a higher level of protection and we have set out more details about this at section 7 below.

#### **Information collection** <a href="#_ref485310613" id="_ref485310613"></a>

#### We collect, store and use any of the following categories of information about you and we refer to this as “personal information” or "personal data" throughout this Privacy Notice: <a href="#_ref485316539" id="_ref485316539"></a>

**Miscellaneous information: information that you submit or input in to our systems through completion of forms, information about your use of our email and IT systems (including system IDs, device IDs and log on data), information obtained through electronic means.**

### How is your information collected? <a href="#_toc513495087" id="_toc513495087"></a>

#### We will receive most of this personal information from you directly (including through the application and recruitment process), although we may also receive some of this information from third parties, such as recruitment agencies, social media or online searches (including LinkedIn), training providers, medical professionals or occupational health providers, former employers or public agencies. We will collect additional personal information in the course of job-related activities throughout the period of you working for us.

#### We may collect this information in a variety of ways. For example, data might be collected through application forms, CVs/resumes, obtained from your passport or other identity documents such as your driving licence, from forms completed by you at the start of or during your engagement, from correspondence with you, or through interviews, meetings or other assessments.

### Use of your personal information <a href="#_toc514706668" id="_toc514706668"></a>

#### We collect, use and store your personal information for a number of purposes, including those set out in 'Appendix 1 - Lawful Grounds for processing Personal Data' of this Privacy Notice.

#### **Your family and emergency contact information:** Separately, we may process personal information about your family, next of kin or emergency contacts so that we can contact them in an emergency type situation. If you disclose information about your family to us or include it in written, electronic or phone communications, we may also have access to this in our systems. If you share personal information with us that relates to other people (for example, former employees or your next of kin), you will need to check with that person that they are happy for you to share it with us, and for us to use it in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

### Our legal bases for using your personal information <a href="#_toc514706669" id="_toc514706669"></a>

#### In order to comply with European data privacy laws, we need to have legal bases for using your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice. We have set out more detail about the legal bases we rely on to process your data in 'Appendix 1 - Lawful Grounds for processing Personal Data'. We consider that in nearly all cases, our legal basis will be one or more of the following:

**our use of your personal information is necessary for the performance of our obligations under our agreement with you (for example, to communicate with you); or**

**our use of your personal information is necessary for complying with our legal obligations, particularly as your engager (or prospective engager) (for example, ensuring health and safety at work or conducting legally required checks on your right to work in the UK); or**

**where our use of your personal information is not necessary for the performance of our obligations, or compliance with our legal obligations, it is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party (for example, to enable us to centralise our HR systems and to use dedicated third party systems, to ensure a safe working environment, to ensure the reliability of our volunteers or to maintain adequate personnel records).**

#### Some of the above grounds for processing will overlap and there may be several grounds which justify our use of your personal information.

#### Where we are relying on our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, we have explained, in this Privacy Notice, what those legitimate interests are.

### Why we collect and use sensitive personal data <a href="#_toc514706670" id="_toc514706670"></a>

#### Sensitive personal data, so called "special categories" of personal data, require higher levels of protection. We need to have further justification for collecting, storing and using this. Special category data is personal data relating to racial or ethnic origins; political opinions; religious and philosophical beliefs; trade union membership; genetic data; biometric data; health data; sex life or sexual orientation. We may process special categories of personal data in the following general circumstances:

**In limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent.**

**Where we need to carry out our legal obligations and/or exercise rights conferred on us by law and in line with our data protection and information handling policy.**

**Where it is needed in the public interest, such as, in some circumstances, forequal opportunities monitoring or in relation to an occupational pension scheme, and in line with our data protection and information handling policy.**

**Where it is needed to assess your working capacity on health grounds, subject to appropriate confidentiality safeguards.**

**Less commonly, we may process this type of information where it is needed in relation to legal claims or where it is needed to protect your (or someone elses) interests and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you have already made the information public.**

#### We will use sensitive personal data (in particular information about your physical or mental health, or disability status) to ensure your health and safety in the workplace and to assess your fitness to work, and to provide appropriate workplace adjustments. <a href="#_bpdc_ln_ins_1093" id="_bpdc_ln_ins_1093"></a>

#### We do not need your consent if we use special categories of your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Notice to carry out our legal obligations or exercise specific rights in the field of employment law. In limited circumstances, we may ask you for your written consent to allow us to process certain particularly sensitive data. If we do so, we will provide you with details of the information that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider whether you wish to consent. You should be aware that it is not a condition of your agreement with us that you agree to any request for consent from us for the processing of your personal information or special categories of personal data. Consent may be withdrawn at any time by contacting \[insert contact detals] - see section 15 of this Privacy Notice for more information on this. <a href="#_bpdc_ln_ins_1089" id="_bpdc_ln_ins_1089"></a>

#### We do not currently request or gather any information regarding political opinions, philosophical belief or trade union membership.

### Information about criminal convictions <a href="#_toc514706671" id="_toc514706671"></a>

#### We do not carry out background checks relating to criminal convictions (DBS checks) and nor do we request or hold information regarding criminal convictions. <a href="#a784736" id="a784736"></a>

### Monitoring <a href="#_toc513495092" id="_toc513495092"></a>

#### We reserve the right to monitor, audit, copy, store or delete any network traffic over our systems. This includes a right to retrieve or access the contents of messages, inboxes or to undertake searches of our email systems for the purposes of monitoring or investigating wrongful acts, to comply with any of our legal or regulatory obligations, or, occasionally to ensure our effective operation (for example in the event of unexpected absence and where access to your Foundation emails is required). Any thing learned by us as a result of such monitoring may be used in relation to disciplinary proceedings. All monitoring activities will be undertaken in accordance with the laws that apply to us.

### How we share your personal information (and who with) <a href="#_toc513495093" id="_toc513495093"></a>

#### We may have to share your data with third parties, including third-party service providers and other entities in our group. <a href="#_bpdc_ln_ins_1011" id="_bpdc_ln_ins_1011"></a>

#### We require third parties to respect the security of your data and to treat it in accordance with the law. Please see section 11 for more information about the basis upon which we transfer your data outside the EEA.

#### **Disclosure within the Company's group:** <a href="#_ref513492453" id="_ref513492453"></a>

**Your business related information will be made available to other Foundation staff, customers, suppliers and agencies in the course of providing our services. This includes your name, work contact details, position related information, photo and other related details.**

**Your personal information may be shared with any company that is a member of the Foundation's group, where it is in our legitimate interests to do so for internal administrative purposes, to effectively operate the employment relationship with you and/or the workforce generally, for management purposes, corporate strategy, auditing and monitoring, system maintenance support and hosting of data and/or research and development. Access to your personal information is limited to those members of staff who need to know the personal information, and may include your managers and their designees, as well as staff members in the HR, recruitment, corporate services, legal, information technology, and finance departments.**

**We may also share your personal information with our group companies where they provide products and services to us, such as IT systems, data hosting, HR services, legal support, payroll and benefits administration and recruitment.**

#### **Disclosure to other third parties:**

**We will share your personal data with third parties where required by law, where it is necessary to administer the working relationship with you or where we have another legitimate interest in doing so.**

**We will share your personal information with the following categories of third parties:**

**other parties such as legal and regulatory authorities (including government departments and HMRC), accountants, auditors, lawyers and other outside professional advisors;**

**customers, clients or suppliers (to the extent they need it) – this will usually just be your Foundation contact details and related information; and**

**companies that provide products and services to us,such as:**

**insurance companies;**

**training providers;**

**parties requesting an employment reference for you;**

**HR services, such as external advisors, applicant tracking providers/systems;**

**cloud storage providers;**

**police and immigration authorities;**

**occupational health assessment providers and medical professionals; and/or**

**IT systems suppliers and support, including providers of HR systems and benefits management, email archiving, telecommunications suppliers, back-up and disaster recovery and cyber security services; and other outsourcing providers, such as contract lease management, and off-site storage providers.**

**We will also disclose your personal information to third parties in some other circumstances:**

**if we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;**

**if the Company or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal information held by the Company will be one of the transferred assets;**

**if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, any lawful request from government or law enforcement officials and as may be required to meet national security or law enforcement requirements or prevent illegal activity;**

**to respond to any claims, to protect our rights or rights of a third party, to protect the safety of any person or to prevent any illegal activity; and/or**

**to protect the rights, property or safety of the Foundation, our staff or other persons.**

#### **Restrictions on use of your personal information by those we share it with**

#### Some of these companies may use your data in countries which are outside of the European Economic Area. We have included more details about this at section 11 below.

#### Any third parties with whom we share your personal information are limited (by law and/or by contract) in their ability to use your personal information and the purposes for which they use it. We will always ensure that any third parties with whom we share your personal information are subject to privacy and security obligations consistent with this Privacy Notice and applicable laws. In respect of third party service providers who are processing data on our behalf, we only permit them to process personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

#### Other than as we have set out in this Privacy Notice, we will not share your personal information to any third party without notifying you and/or obtaining your consent. Where our actions are based on you having given your consent for us to use your information in a particular way, but you later change your mind, you should contact us at \[insert contact details] to notify us of this and we will stop doing so.

### Transfers of information <a href="#_toc514706674" id="_toc514706674"></a>

#### As set out above, personal information may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA working for us, other members of our group or third parties for the purposes mentioned in section 5. By providing us with your personal information you acknowledge any such transfer, storage and use.

#### If we provide any personal information about you to any such non-EEA members of our group or third party data processors, we will take appropriate measures to ensure members of our group and our service providers protect your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice. These measures include entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them.

#### Further details on the steps we take to protect your personal information, in these cases is available from us on request by contacting us at \[insert contact details].

### Retention of personal information <a href="#_toc514706675" id="_toc514706675"></a>

#### We have identified retention guidelines for different types of HR data taking into account the purpose for which data is collected, statutory obligations in respect of the retention of data and limitation periods for the bringing of claims where the data may be evidentially relevant.

#### The indicative retention periods are:

### Recruitment records: 6 months after the later of the point of collection, notification to candidates of the outcome of the recruitment exercise or last contact with the candidate on this. Recruitment information may be transferred to a successful candidate's personnel file to the extent it is relevant to the ongoing relationship.\*

### Personnel records: While the volunteering arrangement continues and up to 7 years after the volunteering arrangement ceases. However, we will review your records at intervals during the volunteering arrangement and upon termination of the volunteering arrangement to assess whether earlier deletion of any particular record is appropriate (where the data is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected and any relevant limitation periods have expired).

### \*We retain personal information following recruitment exercises to demonstrate, if required, that candidates have not been discriminated against on prohibited grounds and that recruitment exercises are conducted in a fair and transparent way.

#### In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you.

#### Once it is no longer necessary to retain your personal information, we will securely destroy it in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

### Change of purpose <a href="#_toc513495095" id="_toc513495095"></a>

#### We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

#### Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

### Your rights <a href="#_toc513495096" id="_toc513495096"></a>

#### You have certain rights in relation to your personal information. If you would like further information in relation to these or would like to exercise any one of them, please contact \[insert contact details]. In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we:

**provide you with a copy of any personal information which we hold about you;**

**update any of your personal information which is out of date or incorrect or incomplete;**

**delete any personal information which we hold about you if it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or processed (or, in some instances, where you have withdrawn your consent or objected to the processing);**

**restrict the way that we process your personal information;**

**provide your personal information to a third party;**

**consider any valid objections which you have to our use of your personalinformation (where we are relying on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) as the basis for the processing or that the processing is in the public interest); and**

**provide a copy of any agreement under which your personal data is transferred outside of the EEA.**

#### We will consider all such requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Please note, however, that certain personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your personal information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. There will be certain circumstances where the right does not apply to you under law and we will review this when we consider a request. <a href="#_bpdc_ln_ins_1037" id="_bpdc_ln_ins_1037"></a>

#### We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. <a href="#_bpdci_171" id="_bpdci_171"></a>

#### You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

#### If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your personal information, please contact \[insert contact details].

### Right to withdraw consent <a href="#_toc513495097" id="_toc513495097"></a>

#### In the limited circumstances where our processing is based on your having provided consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal data for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time.

#### To withdraw your consent, please contact \[insert contact details]. Where these circumstances apply, once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law.

### Keeping us updated <a href="#_ref485323883" id="_ref485323883"></a>

#### It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during your working relationship with us.

### Security <a href="#_toc513495100" id="_toc513495100"></a>

#### The Foundation is committed to protecting personal information from loss, misuse, disclosure, alteration, unauthorised access and destruction and takes all appropriate precautions to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information. Although we make every effort to protect the personal information which you provide to us, the transmission of information over the internet is not completely secure. As such, you acknowledge that we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to us over the internet that any such transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access.

#### Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access any account with us, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

### Automated decision-making <a href="#_toc514706681" id="_toc514706681"></a>

Automated decision-making takes place when an electronic system uses personal information to make a decision without human intervention. We do not engage in automated decision-making and we will notify you in writing if this position changes.

### Third party websites <a href="#_toc513495102" id="_toc513495102"></a>

You may, from time to time, during your engagement, access links to or other websites operated by third parties (e.g. training providers, industry news sources and bulletins). Please note that this Privacy Notice only applies to the personal information that we collect from or about you and we cannot be responsible for personal information collected and stored by third parties. Third party websites have their own terms and conditions and privacy policies, and you should read these carefully before you submit any personal information to these websites. We do not endorse or otherwise accept any responsibility or liability for the content of such third party websites or third party terms and conditions or policies.

### Changes to our Privacy Notice <a href="#_toc514706685" id="_toc514706685"></a>

#### This Privacy Notice does not form part of any engagement agreement/terms and we may amend it from time to time. Any significant changes we make to our Privacy Notice in the future will be notified to you in writing. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes.

### Further questions or making a complaint <a href="#_toc514706686" id="_toc514706686"></a>

#### If you have any queries or complaints about our collection, use or storage of your personal information, or if you wish to exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal information, please contact \[insert contact details]. We will investigate and attempt to resolve any such complaint or dispute regarding the use or disclosure of your personal information

#### You may also make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority in the UK, the Information Commissioner's Office (https://ico.org.uk/). Alternatively, you may seek a remedy through local courts if you believe your rights have been breached.

The practices described in this Privacy Notice statement are current personal information protection policies, as of \[February] 2021.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Notice, please contact \[insert contact details].
