## Revision processes

TIOF, like any other structured organization, is made possible by a complex series of regulations that guide how it implements its mission. As these regulations require to adapt to new realities, mechanisms for their update need be set in place.

The documents that can be subject to revision are:

* Articles of Association
* Organization Statue (this document)
* Policies
* Agreements
* Media Kit

{% hint style="success" %}
The Memorandum of Association does not allow for revisions as it is a foundational document linked to the process of legally registering TIOF.

Any necessary revisions can be stated in either the Articles of Association or the Organization Statute, superseding its clauses. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The following documents do not require to undergo this process and can be updated on-the-go as needed by their corresponding Team:

* Handbooks
* Templates
* Productions
* Org Chart
{% endhint %}

In order to keep the organization as flexible as possible, the following methods of revision are available:

### Regular revision

Regular revisions happen once a year during the Annual Meeting. A dedicated section of the meeting is to be allocated for it.

**When:** Annual Meeting - Once a year

**Requested by:** Any TIOF Member

**Quorum:** As per Annual Meeting regulations

**Approval:**

* New revisions: 50% +1&#x20;
* Contested Continuous revisions: 50% +1
* Non contested Continuous revisions: Automatic

**Validity:** Indefinite unless requested for change.

{% hint style="info" %}
To simplify and consolidate revision processes, it is encouraged to use the Regular revision process.
{% endhint %}

### Continuous revision

To allow for fast adaptation in case of need, and in the spirit of the CI/CD practice, a mechanism to propose and approve revisions outside of the Regular method, is available.

{% hint style="warning" %}
While revisions through this method are immediately valid and implementable, their final approval will be confirmed in the following Regular revision.
{% endhint %}

**When:** Any time

**Requested by:** Any TIOF Member

**Quorum:** 50% +1 of the Team who raised the revision&#x20;
