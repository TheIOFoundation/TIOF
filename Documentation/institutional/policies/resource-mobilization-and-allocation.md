## **Unrestricted and Restricted resources**

In accordance to its Finance Policy, The IO Foundation categorizes all mobilized resources into two distinct categories:

### **Unrestricted resources**

These resources can be used at the discretion of the organization for any project, program, or operational need. Unrestricted resources offer flexibility in their allocation and are vital for the proper functioning of the organization. These resources are typically sourced from general donations, revenue from products or services or grants that do not specify usage.

### **Restricted r**esources&#x20;

Restricted resources are those designated for specific purposes, as defined by the donor, crowdfunding project deliverables or grantor. These resources must be used strictly for the projects, programs or activities outlined in by the source's requirements.

### **Resource Allocation Framework**

The organization ensures that all resources are allocated in an efficient, transparent and accountable manner:

* **For Unrestricted Resources**: These resources are allocated based on the organization's annual Strategic Plan and budget. The budget is approved by the organizationâ€™s leadership and is designed to support strategic goals, operations and initiatives that align with the its Mission.
* **For Restricted Resources:** These resources are allocated directly to the programs, initiatives or projects specified by the donor or grant provider. The organization shall follow the applicable terms of resources to ensure proper usage and reporting. These conditions shall be closely monitored to ensure compliance with the terms of said applicable terms.

#### **Flexibility in Fund Allocation**

Unless a source explicitly instructs that the resources are to be used for a specific project or purpose, The IO Foundation reserves the right to allocate resources to the programs, initiatives, projects or operations it deems most critical. This ensures that the organization can respond to emerging needs and maintain operational efficiency.

## **Monitoring, Reporting and Accountability**

To ensure responsible use of mobilized resources and maintain transparency, The IO Foundation implements a robust system for monitoring, reporting and accountability across all mobilization streams.

* **Financial Oversight:** The finance department ensures that resources are allocated and used in compliance with this policy and applicable laws.
* **Audits:** The organization shall conduct audits of both unrestricted and restricted resources to ensure adherence to the source's requirements and resource allocation integrity.
* **Reporting to Sources:** For restricted funds, the organization shall provide timely and detailed reports on how the resources have been allocated and used to meet the specific goals outlined by the sourcing terms.
