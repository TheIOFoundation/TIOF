**The IO Foundation**, also known as **TIOF**, is a non-stock not-for-profit non-government organization born out of a fundamental concern for the future of digital societies. It is founded at a time whereby emerging technologies blur the divide between the analog and the digital world.

It’s founder and current CEO, Jean François Quéralt, was driven by a strong desire to contribute to the changing landscape of socio-political participation and strongly wishes to create a space that can provide a pathway to ensure the respect of Human Rights in the digital space.

TIOF is legally registered:

* in Estonia in March 2018 through its e-Residency program as a non-profit association under registry code **80549272**.
