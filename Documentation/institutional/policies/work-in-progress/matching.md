## Policy details

### Matching statement



#### **Matching Funds Policy**

**Effective Date:** \[Insert Date]\
**Last Reviewed:** \[Insert Date]

#### **1. Purpose and Scope**

The **Matching Funds Policy** complements the **Resource Mobilization and Allocation Policy** by establishing guidelines for the receipt, management, and allocation of matching funds. Matching funds are contributions made by external entities that match donations raised by \[NGO Name], typically on a one-to-one or similar ratio. This policy ensures that matching funds are used transparently and ethically and that they align with \[NGO Name]’s mission and funding principles.

This policy applies to all staff, partners, and donors involved in fundraising campaigns or programs where matching funds are offered.

#### **2. General Principles**

Matching funds provide an opportunity to amplify individual and organizational donations, helping \[NGO Name] enhance its financial base. However, to ensure that this funding stream remains consistent with \[NGO Name]’s values and operational standards, the following principles must be observed:

* **Mission Alignment:** All matching funds must align with the mission and goals of \[NGO Name], contributing to activities or programs that further the organization’s impact.
* **No Influence Over Independence:** The provision of matching funds must not result in any influence over \[NGO Name]’s decision-making, advocacy, research outcomes, or operations. The organization’s independence remains paramount.
* **Ethical Compliance:** \[NGO Name] will only accept matching funds from entities that comply with legal and ethical standards, including adherence to the organization’s **Economic Sanctions Policy**. Matching donations will not be accepted from sources that are subject to sanctions or that may otherwise compromise the organization’s reputation.
* **Transparency and Accountability:** The organization commits to full transparency in the use and management of matching funds, ensuring that donors, partners, and stakeholders are informed about how their contributions are leveraged and utilized.

#### **3. Definition of Matching Funds**

Matching funds are contributions provided by an external entity, typically a corporation, foundation, or government body, that matches individual or organizational donations at a pre-determined ratio (e.g., one-to-one, two-to-one). Matching funds are often tied to specific fundraising campaigns or periods and serve as an incentive to donors to increase the overall impact of their contributions.

#### **4. Guidelines for Accepting Matching Funds**

**Eligibility for Matching:**\
Donations must meet specific criteria to qualify for matching. These criteria may vary depending on the matching fund provider but typically include:

* Donations made within a set time frame.
* Contributions made by eligible individuals or organizations.
* Adherence to minimum or maximum contribution amounts as stipulated by the matching provider.

**Approval of Matching Partnerships:**\
Before entering into any matching fund agreement, the source of the matching funds must be vetted and approved by the leadership team. This process ensures that the matching donor adheres to \[NGO Name]’s ethical and legal standards and does not compromise the organization’s independence or integrity.

**Conditions of Matching Funds:**\
Any conditions attached to matching funds, such as their allocation to specific programs or projects, must be clearly outlined in the agreement between \[NGO Name] and the matching fund provider. The organization retains the right to decline matching funds if the conditions violate its mission or funding policies.

#### **5. Revenue Allocation and Categorization**

Matching funds are typically considered **restricted funds**, as they are often allocated to specific programs, campaigns, or projects according to the terms of the matching agreement.

**a. Unrestricted Funds**

In cases where matching funds are provided with no specific restrictions, they may be classified as unrestricted funds. This means that they can be allocated to support any aspect of the organization’s operations, as outlined in the **Resource Mobilization and Allocation Policy**.

* **Use of Unrestricted Matching Funds:** Unrestricted matching funds will be allocated according to the organization’s annual budget, supporting general operations, innovative initiatives, or areas of need.

**b. Restricted Funds**

Most matching funds are restricted to the purpose for which the original donations were intended. This means that the funds must be allocated to the designated project or campaign as outlined by the matching fund provider.

* **Use of Restricted Matching Funds:** Restricted matching funds will only be used for the specific project or program for which they were raised, ensuring compliance with the matching provider’s guidelines and the expectations of individual donors.

#### **6. Fundraising Campaigns and Matching**

**Planning Matching Campaigns:**\
When planning a fundraising campaign that involves matching funds, \[NGO Name] will clearly communicate the details of the match to potential donors, including the matching ratio, any applicable deadlines, and the specific purpose for which the funds will be used.

**Promotion and Communication:**\
Marketing materials promoting the matching campaign must clearly explain how the matching process works, the timeline for matching, and any restrictions or conditions associated with the matching funds. Transparency in these communications ensures that donors understand how their contributions are maximized.

#### **7. Monitoring, Reporting, and Accountability**

**Tracking Matching Contributions:**\
All matching contributions will be tracked separately in the organization’s financial systems to ensure transparency and accountability. This includes maintaining records of the original donation and the matching funds, as well as ensuring compliance with any restrictions or conditions attached to the funds.

**Financial Reporting:**\
\[NGO Name] will provide regular financial reports to the matching fund provider and donors as required. These reports will detail how the matching funds were allocated and the impact they had on the organization’s work.

**Impact Reporting:**\
Where applicable, \[NGO Name] will report to donors on the impact of their contributions and how matching funds helped enhance the effectiveness of their donations. These reports will demonstrate how the combined contributions supported specific programs or initiatives.

#### **8. Compliance with Economic Sanctions Policy**

All matching fund providers and sources must comply with \[NGO Name]’s **Economic Sanctions Policy**. \[NGO Name] will not accept matching funds from any individual, organization, or entity subject to sanctions under U.S., international, or local regulations.

#### **9. Ethical and Legal Considerations**

Matching funds must be provided in a manner that complies with all applicable laws, both domestic and international. This includes adhering to financial reporting standards, avoiding conflicts of interest, and ensuring that all parties involved act ethically and transparently.

**Refusal of Matching Funds:**\
\[NGO Name] reserves the right to refuse matching funds from any source that does not align with the organization’s mission, values, or legal obligations. This includes rejecting funds from sources that may compromise the organization’s integrity, reputation, or independence.

#### **10. Review and Amendments**

This Matching Funds Policy will be reviewed annually by the leadership team to ensure it remains aligned with the organization’s evolving needs, legal requirements, and strategic goals. Any amendments to this policy will be communicated to relevant stakeholders and partners.

***

This **Matching Funds Policy** ensures that \[NGO Name] responsibly manages and allocates matching funds, leveraging them to maximize donor contributions while maintaining transparency, ethical integrity, and mission alignment.
