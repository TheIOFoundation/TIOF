### Crowdfunding statement



#### **1. Purpose and Scope**

This Crowdfunding Policy complements the **Resource Mobilization and Allocation Policy** by establishing guidelines for the solicitation, management, and accountability of funds raised through crowdfunding platforms. It ensures that crowdfunding efforts align with \[NGO Name]’s mission, maintain its independence, and comply with legal and ethical standards. This policy applies to all staff, volunteers, and partners involved in crowdfunding campaigns on behalf of \[NGO Name].

#### **2. General Principles**

Crowdfunding is an important funding stream that allows \[NGO Name] to engage with a broad public audience and raise funds for specific projects, programs, or initiatives. All crowdfunding campaigns conducted by or on behalf of the organization must adhere to the following principles:

* **Mission Alignment:** Crowdfunding campaigns must be aligned with \[NGO Name]’s mission, values, and strategic goals. Campaigns must reflect the organization’s core objectives and not compromise its operational or advocacy positions.
* **Independence:** Funds raised through crowdfunding must not compromise \[NGO Name]’s independence. Campaigns must not place any constraints or conditions that influence decision-making, research outcomes, or advocacy.

* **Compliance with Legal and Ethical Standards:** All crowdfunding efforts must comply with applicable laws, including the organization’s **Economic Sanctions Policy** and other relevant legal frameworks. Funds from questionable or illegal sources will not be accepted.

#### **3. Types of Crowdfunding Campaigns**

Crowdfunding campaigns conducted by \[NGO Name] typically fall into two categories:

**a. Project-Based Crowdfunding**

These campaigns focus on raising funds for a specific project, initiative, or activity. Each campaign must have a clear objective and defined use for the funds. Supporters are given a transparent understanding of how their contributions will support the targeted initiative.

* **Use of Funds:** Funds raised for project-based campaigns are categorized as **restricted** and must be used solely for the stated purpose outlined in the campaign. Monitoring and reporting mechanisms ensure compliance with the intended use.

**b. Unrestricted Crowdfunding**

These campaigns focus on raising general funds to support the organization’s core operations or provide flexibility in responding to emerging needs. The funds raised are not tied to a specific project and may be used at the discretion of the organization to support its broader mission.

* **Use of Funds:** Funds raised through unrestricted crowdfunding are categorized as **unrestricted** and may be used for any organizational need, including day-to-day operations, staff support, or emergency response.

#### **4. Crowdfunding Platforms and Campaign Management**

Each campaign must have clear objectives, a detailed budget, and specific outcomes or impacts. Campaign messaging must be truthful and provide accurate information to potential donors about how funds will be used.

**Approval Process:**\
Before launching any crowdfunding campaign, the campaign proposal must be reviewed and approved by the leadership team to ensure alignment with the organization’s goals, compliance with legal standards, and proper resource allocation.

#### **5. Fundraising Goals and Accountability**

**Goal Setting:**\
Each crowdfunding campaign must have a clearly defined financial goal that reflects the actual funding needs of the project or initiative. The goal must be realistic and aligned with the organization’s ability to deliver the promised outcomes.

**Fund Allocation:**\
Crowdfunding funds are allocated based on the type of campaign:

* **For Project-Based Crowdfunding:** These funds are categorized as **restricted** and allocated strictly for the project or purpose specified in the campaign. The organization will ensure these funds are used only for their intended purpose.
* **For Unrestricted Crowdfunding:** These funds are categorized as **unrestricted** and can be used at the organization’s discretion to support ongoing operations or other needs. Unrestricted funds will be allocated according to the organization’s annual budget.

#### **6. Monitoring, Reporting, and Donor Communication**

**Monitoring:**\
All crowdfunding funds, whether restricted or unrestricted, will be monitored by the finance team to ensure that they are used according to donor expectations and legal requirements. For project-based campaigns, expenditures are tracked to ensure alignment with the campaign’s stated purpose.

**Reporting:**\
\[NGO Name] is committed to keeping donors informed of the impact of their contributions. For project-based campaigns, the organization will provide updates on the progress of the project and the use of funds, either through the crowdfunding platform or via direct communication with donors. For unrestricted campaigns, the organization will report on the general impact of contributions and how they are supporting the broader mission.

Donors will receive acknowledgments for their contributions and be informed about how their funds are making a difference. Transparency is key, and the organization will ensure that donors have access to relevant updates on the outcomes of campaigns.

The organization will maintain accurate financial records of all crowdfunding contributions. Regular financial reports will be provided to leadership and, where necessary, shared with the public to maintain trust and accountability.

**Audit and Compliance:**\
Crowdfunding activities are subject to the same financial oversight and auditing processes as other streams of funding. Internal and external audits may be conducted to ensure that funds are properly accounted for and used in compliance with this policy.

#### **9. Donor Privacy and Data Protection**

#### **10. Right to Refuse or Cancel Campaigns**

\[NGO Name] reserves the right to cancel or refuse crowdfunding campaigns or donations if they do not meet the ethical, legal, or operational standards outlined in this policy.
