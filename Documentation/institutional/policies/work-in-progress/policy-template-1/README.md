## Policy details

### XXXX statement



**Organizational Standards and Measurement Policy**

This policy document would encompass global standards for The IO Foundation, including the use of the Metric System for all measurements, as well as other universal guidelines such as currency standards, time formats, or documentation protocols. It would serve as a centralized reference to ensure consistency and clarity across all organizational operations, activities, and records.



**Metric System Policy**

The IO Foundation adopts the Metric System as the standard for all measurements across its operations, activities, and documentation. All distances, weights, volumes, and other quantitative measures must be expressed in metric units (e.g., kilometers, kilograms, liters) to ensure consistency, clarity, and alignment with international standards. This policy applies to all members, projects, and initiatives, including expense filings, reimbursements, and activity planning. Any conversions from non-metric units, if required, must be clearly documented and converted to metric units for official records.



### 4. Time and Date Formats

#### 4.1 Time Format

* All time references must use the 24-hour military format (HH:MM, e.g., 14:30) in UTC+0 time zone, unless otherwise specified.
* In cases where a different time zone is required (e.g., for specific activities or teams), the applicable time zone must be clearly documented, with conversions to UTC+0 provided for official records.

#### 4.2 Date Format

* Dates must be recorded in the format DD/MM/YYYY (e.g., 22/07/2025) or as the full text format "dddd mmmm yyyy" (e.g., Tuesday July 2025) for formal documentation, calendars, and communications.
* Months follow the solar cycle, with the year starting on January 1st.

#### 4.3 Week Structure

* The working week is defined as Monday through Friday, with Monday as the first day of the week.
* Organizational and team-wide calendars must reflect this structure for scheduling and planning.

#### 4.4 Reference Days

* Winter Time reference: January 1st (00:00:00 UTC+0).
* Summer Time reference: July 1st (00:00:00 UTC+0).

#### 4.5 Deadlines

* All deadlines are set to 00:00:00 UTC+0 on the day immediately following the specified deadline date (e.g., a deadline of July 22, 2025, expires at 00:00:00 UTC+0 on July 23, 2025).
* Deadlines apply to all submissions, including expense filings, invoices, and project deliverables, unless otherwise specified.

#### 4.6 Compliance

* All organizational calendars, data entries, and deadlines must adhere to the above time and date standards.
* Any deviations (e.g., use of alternative time zones or formats) must be pre-approved and documented with reference to UTC+0 for consistency.



#### 3.2 Temperature Measurement (Celsius)

* All temperature measurements must be expressed in degrees Celsius (Â°C) for consistency and alignment with the Metric System.
* Non-Celsius units (e.g., Fahrenheit), if encountered, must be converted to Celsius for all official records, reports, and communications, with conversions clearly documented.
* This standard applies to all organizational activities, including but not limited to activity planning, environmental reporting, and equipment specifications.
