## Policy details

### Donations statement











#### **1. Purpose and Scope**

This Donations Policy complements the **Resource Mobilization and Allocation Policy** by outlining the principles, processes, and guidelines governing the solicitation, acceptance, and management of donations for \[NGO Name]. It ensures that donations align with the organization’s mission, respect its independence, and comply with legal and ethical standards. This policy applies to all staff, volunteers, and partners involved in fundraising and donation management.

#### **2. General Principles**

\[NGO Name] accepts donations from individuals, corporations, foundations, and other entities, provided the donation:

* **Maintains the Organization’s Independence:** Donations will not be accepted if they come with conditions that could influence or compromise the organization’s mission, decision-making processes, policies, or operational autonomy.
* **No Strings Attached:** Donors may suggest areas of focus, but \[NGO Name] retains full control over how the donations are used unless the donation is categorized as **restricted**. Donations will not dictate the organization’s research, activities, or advocacy positions.
* **Transparency and Integrity:** \[NGO Name] is committed to ensuring transparency in all its dealings with donors. All accepted donations will be managed with integrity, recorded accurately, and acknowledged according to the organization’s standards.
* **Compliance with Legal Standards:** Donations will only be accepted if they comply with relevant laws, including our **Economic Sanctions Policy**, and do not involve illegal, unethical, or questionable sources of funding.

#### **3. Types of Donations**

Donations to \[NGO Name] fall under two main categories:

**a. Unrestricted Donations**

Unrestricted donations provide the organization with maximum flexibility, allowing funds to be used at the organization’s discretion for any purpose that supports its mission. These donations are invaluable for operational sustainability and ongoing programs.

* **Use of Unrestricted Donations:** Unrestricted donations are allocated according to the organization’s annual budget, ensuring they are directed to areas of greatest need, including core operations, new initiatives, and unforeseen challenges.

**b. Restricted Donations**

Restricted donations are those provided by a donor with specific instructions on how the funds should be used, such as for a particular project, program, or geographic area. The organization accepts restricted donations only if the specified purpose aligns with its mission and priorities.

* **Use of Restricted Donations:** Restricted donations are allocated solely for the designated purpose as outlined by the donor. The organization ensures strict adherence to the donor’s instructions, with regular monitoring to ensure compliance.

#### **4. Acceptance Criteria**

\[NGO Name] exercises caution when accepting donations to ensure that they do not:

* Compromise the organization’s ability to make independent decisions or operate freely.
* Contravene legal or regulatory requirements, including economic sanctions.
* Involve entities or individuals with conflicting interests or those associated with illegal or unethical activities.

**Donor Vetting:**\
Before accepting any significant donations, the organization conducts due diligence to assess the donor’s background, ensuring the source of funds is lawful and ethical. Donations from anonymous sources will be subject to additional scrutiny to prevent potential conflicts with legal standards or organizational values.

**Right to Decline Donations:**\
\[NGO Name] reserves the right to decline any donation that does not meet its criteria for ethical funding or could harm its reputation, mission, or operations.

#### **5. Donor Recognition**

\[NGO Name] acknowledges and thanks its donors in a transparent manner. Donor recognition can take the form of public acknowledgment on the website, in reports, or during events, unless the donor requests anonymity. However, accepting a donation does not imply an endorsement of the donor’s views or activities, nor will donor recognition grant influence over the organization’s policies or operations.

#### **6. Use and Allocation of Donations**

The use and allocation of donations are managed based on the type of donation:

* **Unrestricted Donations:** Allocated within the framework of the organization’s annual budget and strategic priorities. These funds are essential for day-to-day operations, general support, and organizational growth.
* **Restricted Donations:** Allocated strictly according to the donor’s specified purpose, with adherence to donor agreements and reporting requirements.

The finance department ensures proper allocation and tracking of all donations, and regular financial reports are produced to ensure accountability.

#### **7. Monitoring, Reporting, and Accountability**

**Monitoring and Compliance:**\
The organization carefully monitors the use of all donations, ensuring that restricted donations are used as intended and unrestricted donations support organizational needs. Regular audits and reviews are conducted to verify compliance with this policy.

**Donor Reporting:**\
For restricted donations, \[NGO Name] provides periodic reports to donors, detailing the use of funds and the impact achieved. These reports include financial data and project updates, ensuring transparency and accountability to the donor.

**Financial Oversight:**\
The organization maintains clear and accurate financial records for all donations. The finance team tracks all contributions, ensuring that resources are managed effectively and in compliance with donor agreements and legal requirements.
