### About this document

This document, hereinafter the Policy, sets out the position maintained by TIOF in matters of **Equality of Opportunities** that you will need to be aware of while being a TIOF Member. You should familiarize yourself with it and comply with it at all times.

This Policy sets out TIOF's approach to equal opportunities and the avoidance of discrimination at work. It applies to all aspects of employment with us, including (although not limited to) recruitment, pay and conditions, training, appraisals, promotion, conduct at work, disciplinary and grievance procedures and termination of employment.

Any Member who breaches this Policy will face disciplinary action, which could result in dismissal for gross misconduct. Any non-employee who breaches this Policy may have their contract (or equivalent official relationship with TIOF) terminated with immediate effect.

## Policy details

### Equal opportunities statement

{% hint style="success" %}
The IO Foundation is committed to promoting equal opportunities for all individuals to become TIOF Members.\
Any applicants, irrespective of their position or type of engagement, will receive equal treatment regardless of any personal immutable characteristic dimension that essentially amplifies differences among people instead of embracing their similarities.
{% endhint %}

### Discrimination

Members must not unlawfully discriminate against or harass other people including current and former TIOF Members or Contributors.

This applies in the workplace, outside the workplace (when dealing with customers, suppliers or other work-related contacts) and on work-related trips or events, including social events.

The following forms of discrimination are prohibited under this Policy and are unlawful:

* **Direct discrimination:** treating someone less favorably because of a given personal characteristic dimension.
* **Indirect discrimination:** a provision, criterion or practice that applies to everyone but adversely affects people with a particular personal characteristic dimension more than others and is not justified.
* **Retaliation:** treating someone that has complained or has supported someone else's complaint about discrimination or harassment less favorably. Harassment is dealt with further in our [Anti-harassment and Anti-Bullying Policy](https://tiof.click/TIOFPolicyAHAB).

### Recruitment and selection

Recruitment, promotion and other selection exercises such as redundancy selection will be conducted **exclusively on the basis of merit and strictly following objective criteria that avoid discrimination.** Shortlisting should be done by more than one person if possible.

{% hint style="info" %}
Vacancies should always be advertised in all official [Human Resources Channels](https://tiof.click/TIOFHBComms#channel-types) and ensure avoid using any wording that may discourage particular citizens from applying.
{% endhint %}

Applicants should not be asked questions which might suggest an intention to discriminate on the grounds of any given personal characteristic dimension. Should the question be unavoidable, it must be done on the grounds of examining options to overcome observed difficulties.

Applicants should not be asked about health or disability before a position offer is made, except in the very limited circumstances allowed by law: for example, to check that the applicant could perform an intrinsic part of the position (taking account of any reasonable adjustments) or to see if any adjustments might be needed at the interview because of a disability.

{% hint style="success" %}
Where necessary, position offers can be made conditional on a satisfactory medical check.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Health or disability questions may be included in equal opportunities monitoring forms, which must not be used for selection or decision-making purposes.
{% endhint %}

### Disabilities

If you are disabled or become disabled, we encourage you to tell us about your condition so that we can consider what reasonable adjustments or support may be appropriate.

In any case, this is not mandatory unless the disability affects your ability to perform your responsibilities as described in your [Engagement Document](https://tiof.click/TIOFTerminology#engagement-document).

### Part-time and fixed-term work

Part-time and fixed-term Members should be treated the same as comparable full-time or permanent Members and enjoy no less favorable terms and conditions (on a pro-rata basis where appropriate), unless different treatment is (**and must be**) justified.

### Breaches of this Policy

{% hint style="warning" %}
The IO Foundation takes a strict approach to breaches of this Policy, which will be dealt with in accordance with our [Disciplinary Procedures](https://tiof.click/TIOFHBHR#disciplinary-procedures).
{% endhint %}

Serious cases of deliberate discrimination may amount to gross misconduct resulting in dismissal.

If you believe that you have suffered discrimination you can raise the matter through our [Grievance Procedures](https://tiof.click/TIOFHBHR#grievance-procedures).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complaints will be treated in confidence and investigated as appropriate.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**You shall not be retaliated against for complaining about discrimination.**\
However, making a false allegation deliberately and in bad faith will be treated as misconduct and dealt with under our [Disciplinary Procedure](https://tiof.click/TIOFHBHR#disciplinary-procedures) with the same determination as the allegation.
{% endhint %}
