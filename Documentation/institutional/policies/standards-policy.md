## Policy details

### Standards statement

{% hint style="success" %}
The IO Foundation is committed to adopt and enforce clear and consistent standards for measurements, time, date formats.

All members, no matter their role, must follow these policies to ensure accuracy and uniformity across all organizational operations.
{% endhint %}

## **Measurements**

The IO Foundation adopts the Metric System as the standard for all measurements across its operations. As a result, all distances, weights, volumes and other quantitative measures must be expressed in metric units (e.g., kilometers, kilograms, liters).

{% hint style="info" %}
Any conversions from non-metric units, if required, must be clearly documented and converted to metric units for official records.
{% endhint %}

## Time and Date

The IO Foundation adopts the following:

#### Time Format

* The official time zone of reference is UTC+00.
* All time references must use the 24-hour military format (HH:MM, e.g., 14:30) in UTC+00 time zone, unless otherwise specified.
* In cases where a different time zone is required (e.g., for specific activities or teams), the applicable time zone must be clearly documented, with conversions to UTC+00 provided for official records.

#### Date Format

* Months follow the solar cycle, with the year starting on January 1st.
* Dates must be noted in the format DD/MM/YYYY (e.g., 22/07/2025) or as the full text format "dddd mmmm yyyy" (e.g., Tuesday July 2025) for formal documentation, calendars and communications.
* In certain contexts such as Filenaming, dates must be noted in the format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2025-07-22).

{% hint style="info" %}
Please refer to the corresponding documentation for more details on when to use each format.
{% endhint %}

#### Week Structure

* The working week is defined as Monday through Friday, with Monday as the first day of the week.
* Organizational and team-wide calendars must reflect this structure for scheduling and planning.

#### Reference Days

* Winter Time reference: January 1st (00:00:00 UTC+0).
* Summer Time reference: July 1st (00:00:00 UTC+0).

#### Deadlines

* All deadlines are set to 00:00:00 UTC+0 on the day immediately following the specified deadline date (e.g., a deadline of July 22, 2025, expires at 00:00:00 UTC+0 on July 23, 2025).
* Deadlines apply to all submissions, including expense filings, invoices and project deliverables, unless otherwise specified (in which case a clear description of the exception must be explained and approved).

#### Compliance

* All organizational calendars, data entries and deadlines must adhere to the above time and date standards.
* Any deviations (e.g., use of alternative time zones or formats) must be pre-approved and documented with reference to UTC+0 for consistency.

## Temperature

* All temperature measurements must be expressed in degrees Celsius (Â°C) for consistency and alignment with the Metric System.
* Non-Celsius units (e.g., Fahrenheit), if encountered, must be converted to Celsius for all official records, reports and communications, with conversions clearly added.
