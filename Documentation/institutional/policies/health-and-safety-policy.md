{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Health and Safety is a collective effort**

All TIOF Members share responsibility for achieving safe working conditions.

You must take care of your own health and safety and that of others, observe applicable safety rules and follow instructions for the safe use of equipment. You must cooperate with Management on health and safety matters, including the investigation of any incident.

Failure to comply with this policy may be treated as misconduct and dealt with under our [Disciplinary Procedure](http://tiof.click/ProcedureDisciplinary).
{% endhint %}

### Health and Safety Officer

The position of Health and Safety Officer, or HSO, unless otherwise specified, falls on the \[TIOF] Team Human Resources Manager.

You should report any health and safety concerns immediately to the HSO.

The HSO is expected to make himself/herself available to the Board of Directors and Management to report in matters of Health and Safety any time necessary.

{% hint style="info" %}
The time invested by the HSO position computes as working hours and shall never represent extra hours on top of the Working Period as described in the corresponding engagement document.
{% endhint %}

### Team Health and Safety

The organization will put in place a Health and Safety Team, or THS, to support the HSO in evaluating, designing, implementing and disseminating training for required Health and Safety protocols.

{% hint style="info" %}
Team Health and Safety is a part of \[TIOF] Team Human Resources.
{% endhint %}

### Information and consultation

The organization will inform and consult the Health and Safety Officer or directly with all staff regarding health and safety matters.

### Health and Safety Status Meetings

The HST will convene at least once during the General Meeting to determine if specific steps are to be implemented in the coming Season.

Other Status Meetings as well as Emergency Meetings can be conveyed and initiated by:

* The Health and Safety Officer
* Management
* Board of Directors

## Training

The organization will ensure that all TIOF Members are given adequate training and supervision to perform their responsibilities competently and safely. TIOF Members will be given a Health and Safety Induction during their Onboarding. Further training will be provided as needs arise.

## Equipment

TIOF Members must use TIOF equipment in accordance with any instructions given by the organization. Any equipment fault or damage must immediately be reported to the Health and Safety Officer.

{% hint style="warning" %}
TIOF Members shall not attempt to repair equipment unless trained to do so.
{% endhint %}

## Accidents and first aid

Details of first aid facilities are listed in the [Health & Safety Handbook](https://tiof.click/TIOFPolicyHS#first-aid-facilities).

The list of trained first aiders are made available on our [TIOF Org Chart](https://tiof.click/TIOFOrgChart).

All accidents and injuries at work, however minor, should be reported to

* the Health and Safety Officer or,
* your corresponding Team Manager or,
* your corresponding Team Human Resources Manager.

All incidents are to be recorded in the [Accident Book](http://tiof.click/TIOFAccidentBook).

## Fire safety

All TIOF Members should familiarize themselves with the fire safety instructions in their physical offices (when applicable), which are displayed on notice boards and near fire exits in the workplace.

This should also be considered should the Member perform duties remotely, for instance from a co-working space, an event they are attending or from their own residence.

At the hearing of a fire alarm, TIOF Members are to leave the building immediately by the nearest fire exit and go to the fire assembly point outside of the premises.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**RULE OF THE 60 SECONDS**

Fire alarm tests as well as false alarms are not unusual. To ensure that an alarm is in fact real and requires evacuation, you can use the following rule:

Time of alarm < 60 seconds: Be ready and remain alert, observing the situation from where you are. If the alarm stops, resume your activities.

Time of alarm > 60 seconds: Proceed to evacuate calmly, following the [evacuation procedures detailed in the Health and Safety Handbook](https://tiof.click/TIOFPolicyHS#evacuation-procedures).
{% endhint %}

For physical offices, fire drills will be held at least every 12 months and must be taken seriously.

TIOF will also carry out regular fire risk assessments and regular checks of fire extinguishers, fire alarms, escape routes and emergency lighting whenever applicable.

## Risk assessments and measures to control risk

The organization carries out general workplace risk assessments periodically, both in physical offices and remotely. The purpose of these assessments is to identify potential risks to health and safety of TIOF Members, visitors and other third parties as a result of TIOF's activities and to identify any measures that need to be taken to control those risks.
