## Policy details

### Whistleblowing statement

{% hint style="success" %}
The IO Foundation is committed to conducting its advocacy and all of its business in an honest and Rights & Obligations manner and expects all TIOF Members and Contributors to maintain high standards in this regard. Any suspected wrongdoing should be reported as soon as possible and will be investigated with the outmost confidentiality.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
It is crucial to understand that a whistleblowing scenario is never desired. Should the concerns raised be proven to be true, it is not the whistleblower's fault, rather the organization's.

In other words, whistleblowing can only happen if the organization hasn't done its job properly.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please remember that **presumption of innocence** applies to everyone.

This applies to both the whistleblower and the organization alike.
{% endhint %}

### What is whistleblowing?

Whistleblowing is the reporting of suspected wrongdoing or dangers in relation to our activities. This includes, although not limited to, bribery, facilitation of tax evasion, fraud or other criminal activity, miscarriages of justice, health and safety risks, damage to the environment and any breach of legal or professional obligations.

{% hint style="danger" %}
When judging if a wrongdoing may have occurred, it is important to evaluate **the intention** behind it.
{% endhint %}

### How to raise a concern

If you have any whistleblowing concerns, you should contact your corresponding Team Human Resources Manager.

We will arrange a meeting with you as soon as possible to discuss your concern. You may bring a colleague or union representative to any meetings under this Policy.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Your companion must respect the confidentiality of your disclosure and any subsequent investigation.
{% endhint %}

### Confidentiality

We hope that Members will feel able to voice whistleblowing concerns openly under this Policy. Completely anonymous disclosures are difficult to investigate. If you want to raise your concern confidentially, we will make every effort to keep your identity secret and only reveal it where necessary to those involved in investigating your concern.

### External disclosures

The aim of this Policy is to provide an internal mechanism for reporting, investigating and remedying any wrongdoing in the workplace. In most cases you should not find it necessary to alert anyone externally.

The law recognizes however that in some circumstances it may be appropriate for you to report your concerns to an external body such as a regulator. We strongly encourage you to seek advice before reporting a concern to anyone external. Some organizations specialize in such advice. You can find some [Contacts](whistleblowing-policy.md#contacts) at the end of this Policy.

### Protection and support for whistleblowers

We aim to encourage openness and will support whistleblowers who raise **genuine** concerns under this policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken.

Whistleblowers must not suffer any detrimental treatment as a result of raising a **genuine** concern. If you believe that you have suffered any such treatment, you should inform your corresponding Team Human Resources Manager immediately. If the matter is not remedied you should raise it formally using as stated in the [Grievances section under TIOF's Human Resources Policy](https://tiof.click/TIOFPolicyHR#grievances).

### Retaliation

You, or any other TIOF Member or Contributor, must not threaten or retaliate against whistleblowers in any way. If you are involved in such conduct you may be subject to disciplinary action. We wish to note that in some cases the whistleblower could have a right to sue personally for compensation in an employment tribunal.

### False allegations

Should we conclude that a whistleblower has made **false allegations** or acted in an otherwise malicious intention, the whistleblower may be subject to disciplinary action according to our [Disciplinary Measures section under TIOF's Human Resources Policy](https://tiof.click/TIOFPolicyHR#disciplinary-measures).

### Contacts

The following is a non exhaustive list of external organizations to which you could reach out to seek advise on whistleblowing.

{% hint style="info" %}
Should you wish to suggest additional external organizations to be added to the list, please reach out to your corresponding Team Human Resources Manager.
