## Policy details

### Anti corruption and Anti bribery statement

The IO Foundation is committed to conducting its advocacy and all of its business in an honest and ethical manner. We take a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption and are committed to acting professionally, fairly, with integrity and under the observance of the law in all our operations, business dealings and relationships.

### What is bribery?

"Bribe" means a financial or other inducement or reward for action which is illegal, unethical, a breach of trust or improper in any way. Bribes can take the form of (although not limited to) money, gifts, loans, fees, hospitality, services, discounts, the award of a contract or any other advantage or benefit.

"Bribery" includes offering, promising, giving, accepting or seeking a _bribe_.

All forms of bribery are strictly prohibited. If you are unsure about whether a particular act constitutes bribery, raise it with your corresponding Team Human Resources Coordinator.

Specifically, you must not:

* give or offer any payment, gift, hospitality or other benefit in the expectation that a business advantage will be received in return or to reward any business received;
* accept any offer from a third party that you know or suspect is made with the expectation that we will provide a business advantage for them or anyone else;
* give or offer any payment (sometimes called a facilitation payment) to a government official in any country to facilitate or speed up a routine or necessary procedure.

You must not threaten or retaliate against another person who has refused to offer or accept a bribe or who has raised concerns about possible bribery or corruption.

### Gifts and hospitality

This Policy does not prohibit the giving or accepting of reasonable and appropriate hospitality for legitimate purposes such as building relationships, maintaining our image or reputation or marketing our products and services.

A gift or hospitality will not be appropriate if it is unduly lavish or extravagant, or could be seen as an inducement or reward for any preferential treatment (for example, during contractual negotiations or a tender process). All such tokens of appreciation are to be notified to your corresponding Team Human Resources Coordinator.

Gifts must be of an appropriate type and value depending on the circumstances and taking account of the reason for the gift. Gifts must not include cash or cash equivalent (such as vouchers) and in any case be given in secret. Gifts must be given in our name, not your name.

Promotional gifts of low value such as branded stationery may be given to or accepted from existing customers, suppliers and business partners.

### Record-keeping

You must declare and keep a written record of all hospitality or gifts given or received. You must also submit all expenses claims relating to hospitality, gifts or payments to third parties in accordance with our [Financial Procedures](http://tiof.click/ProceduresFinancial) and record the reason for expenditure.

All accounts, invoices, and other records relating to dealings with third parties including suppliers and customers should be prepared with strict accuracy and completeness. Accounts must not be kept "off-book" to facilitate or conceal improper payments.

### How to raise a concern

### Conduct outside of Work

We do not seek to interfere with the personal lives or conduct of our Members. However, some times certain conducts outside of work can interfere with our legitimate advocacy and/or business interests. You are expected to conduct your personal affairs in a manner that doesn't adversely affect the integrity, reputation or credibility of yourself and/or The IO Foundation. Illegal or immoral conduct outside of work by any Member that adversely affects our legitimate advocacy and/or business interests, or other TIOF Member's ability to perform their responsibilities, will not be tolerated.
