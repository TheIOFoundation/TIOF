### What is whistleblowing?

Whistleblowing is the reporting of suspected wrongdoing or dangers in relation to our activities. This includes bribery, facilitation of tax evasion, fraud or other criminal activity, miscarriages of justice, health and safety risks, damage to the environment and any breach of legal or professional obligations.

### How to raise a concern

If you have any whistleblowing concerns, you should contact your corresponding Team Human Resources Coordinator.

We will arrange a meeting with you as soon as possible to discuss your concern. You may bring a colleague or union representative to any meetings under this Policy. Your companion must respect the confidentiality of your disclosure and any subsequent investigation.

### Confidentiality

We hope that Members will feel able to voice whistleblowing concerns openly under this Policy. Completely anonymous disclosures are difficult to investigate. If you want to raise your concern confidentially, we will make every effort to keep your identity secret and only reveal it where necessary to those involved in investigating your concern.

### External disclosures

The aim of this Policy is to provide an internal mechanism for reporting, investigating and remedying any wrongdoing in the workplace. In most cases you should not find it necessary to alert anyone externally.

The law recognizes however that in some circumstances it may be appropriate for you to report your concerns to an external body such as a regulator. We strongly encourage you to seek advice before reporting a concern to anyone external. Some organizations specialize in such advice. You can find some Contacts at the end of this Policy.

### Protection and support for whistleblowers

We aim to encourage openness and will support whistleblowers who raise genuine concerns under this policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken.

Whistleblowers must not suffer any detrimental treatment as a result of raising a genuine concern. If you believe that you have suffered any such treatment, you should inform your corresponding Team Human Resources Coordinator immediately. If the matter is not remedied you should raise it formally using our [Grievance Procedure](http://tiof.click/ProceduresGrievance).

### Retaliation

You must not threaten or retaliate against whistleblowers in any way. If you are involved in such conduct you may be subject to disciplinary action. We wish to note that in some cases the whistleblower could have a right to sue you personally for compensation in an employment tribunal.

### False allegations

Should we conclude that a whistleblower has made false allegations maliciously, the whistleblower may be subject to disciplinary action according to your [Disciplinary Procedures](http://tiof.click/ProcedureDisciplinary).
