### About this document

This document sets out the standards established by TIOF in matters of Intellectual Property you will need to be aware of while being a Member for TIOF. It establishes all necessary considerations in the creation of materials of different nature (including but not limited to documents, articles, books, images, videos and datasets) and how the applicable IP will be established and communicated. You should familiarize yourself with them and comply with them at all times. Any questions you may have with regard to its contents or what you have to do to comply with it should be referred to your corresponding Team Comms Coordinator, who is the ultimate responsible for its application.

Any Member who breaches this Policy will face disciplinary action, which could result in dismissal for gross misconduct. Any non-Member who breaches this Policy may have their contract (or equivalent official relationship with TIOF) terminated with immediate effect.
