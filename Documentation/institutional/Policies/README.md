## About

This section contains the list of Policies that guide The IO Foundation as an organization in order to achieve its Mission and realize its Vision.

## Guiding values

The IO Foundationâ€™s policy framework is a tapestry woven with the threads of European Enlightenment, a period marked by the burgeoning of reason, individualism and a pursuit for knowledge. Our policies are constructed upon a foundation of timeless values that have been pivotal in shaping modern societies.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Humanism and the Value of human life:**  We emphasize the importance of each individual's dignity and worth by cherishing the intrinsic value of human life, human rights and equality of opportunity.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Individual Liberties and Autonomy:** We respect individual autonomy, fostering freedom of expression, promoting freedom of thought and upholding the presumption of innocence to reflect our commitment to personal freedoms and civil liberties.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Rationality and Empiricism:** We uphold objective reality by embracing the scientific method and the encouragement of empirical evidence. We highlight a focus on reason, scientific inquiry and evidence-based understanding as foundations for knowledge and policy.
{% endhint %}

These cornerstone values underpin our commitment to devising solutions that are effective and human-centric as much as technically robust and anchored in the bedrock of objective reality.

## Additional scopes

The IO Foundation operates as a global network, guided by a cohesive framework of policies designed to uphold our standards, mission and vision across all regions in which we operate. These policies serve as the backbone of our governance, ensuring consistency, accountability and integrity throughout the organization.

Taking into account that the international landscape is complex, with various jurisdictions imposing their own legal and regulatory requirements, there are circumstances where our policies might require adaptations with local regulations. As a result, specific policies may partially be overridden or modified in order to achieve compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.

The IO Foundation is dedicated to not only maintaining compliance but also to providing a clear understanding of how its policies apply within different legal contexts. Whenever such customizations may be necessary, they will be clearly documented. These exceptions will be noted directly within the text of the corresponding organization's policy documents.

## Implementation

TIOF's Policies are implemented through corresponding Handbooks, which are referenced in their text.

## Future improvements

The IO Foundation is committed to implement the following improvements on its policies:

* Optimizing them to be reusable by other organizations
* Expanding their documentation with process-driven diagrams
* Making them machine-readable
