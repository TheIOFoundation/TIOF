## General approach

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

* All \[TIOF Members] (https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/TIOF/wiki/Terminology#member)

### Usage

TIOF employs any outreach channel only to update its beneficiaries, partners and Members about the following:

* The progress of its advocacy
* Updates on its projects
* Announcements (such as events organized by TIOF or in which TIOF participates)
* Official statements
* Exposing disinformation relative to its advocacy and technology in general

Note on Comments and Reactions: TIOF will not engage in exchanges that users may initiate as a result of its media outreach campaigns and will, to the extend of the settings available per platform, undertake the necessary configuration measures to disable such options.

### Types of Media Channel

The IO Foundation categorizes their media Media Channels under several dimensions, one of them being the [Update Mode](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/TIOF/wiki/Terminology#update-mode), and accordingly adopts a different strategy in order to maximize the adoption of its advocacy while finding ways to reach out to its beneficiaries. For more details on the [Update Mode](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/TIOF/wiki/Terminology#update-mode) please refer to each Media Channel definition below.

Update Mode:

* Cast::XXX TIOF owns/controls this Media Channel. TIOF will publish content in accordance to its own schedule. Content customization will not be the norm. \[WTI]
* Targeted::XXX TIOF has some endpoint ID with the beneficiary. TIOF will approach beneficiaries using there endpoint ID and customizing the contents whenever possible. \[WTI]

## For media organizations

This section provides guidance for media channels in their mention to The IO Foundation, its advocacy and the programs it implements on their channels.

The IO Foundation encourages media organizations to actively participate in the dissemination of knowledge and news about the advocacy of Data-Centric Digital Rights.

For any further clarifications, please send your inquires to Media@TheIOFoundation.org

### About Social Media

Where do we stand on Social Media (and equivalent platforms)

In order to enable meaningful impact for its advocacy, The IO Foundation needs to reach out to its beneficiaries and stakeholders. In an eminently connected and ever increasing digital world, it is inevitable to use the platforms in which they interact and from which they obtain their news.

It is clear that most of these platforms do not embrace business models that are conducive to the observance of Human and Digital Rights; they simply are merely following regulations. And reluctantly, at that.

Under the current circumstances, The IO Foundation is compelled to find a that a balance between achieving impact through outreach and minimize its participation in such practices so as to reduce both the extraction of users' data and the generation of metadata that may be used for \[harmful outcomes].

We do have profiles there. They are empty and mostly there to protect the organization from identity theft. If you find us, please don’t “Like” us, don’t “Follow us” or anything alike. We don’t support

The IO Foundation is actively researching alternative methods to reach out to its beneficiaries, stakeholders and partners that would be more aligned with the concept of Rights. If you'd like to participate in this research, visit our [discussion](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/BiT/discussions/4).

TIOF discourages the use of mainstream social media platform for a number of reasons:

* Data extraction from its users This happens at several levels: Direct Data Collection + Inferred Data Collection + Human Sensor Collection
* Segmentation of users, fostering the creation of echo chambers
* Application of behavior modification algorithms

If you wish to know more about these effects, we encourage you to observe the following information: \[WIP]

### Declaration

To the citizen: The IO Foundation has used this platform with the sole purpose of communicating information related to its advocacy and events. We understand that its usage may have become fundamental in your daily activities and needs. It is important to understand, however, that this platform may be collecting more information about you than you expect or wish or even consented to. We encourage you to take a stand on this matter and demand that the platform operates under the principle of Rights by Design. Should the platform not change in the way they operate, we encourage you to stop using it and move towards alternatives that focus on keeping your data secure and away from abuse.

To the channel: The IO Foundation has used your platform with the sole purpose of communicating information related to its advocacy and events. We do not endorse in any way possible malpractices on collecting users' data as a result of their interaction with it and invite you to revisit your business model accordingly. In particular, we invite you to revise your technology stack and pivot towards the observance of the Rights by Design principle.

About general use of channels: The IO Foundation believes that free, open communication is key to face and solve the challenges that digital societies are experiencing and therefore any technological means of communication should enable the discovery of solutions. We deplore "Cancel culture" and invite citizens and platforms to be more open and acceptant of both scientific facts (those that made possible the existence of technology to being with) and opinions that may not conform to mainstream ideologies.
