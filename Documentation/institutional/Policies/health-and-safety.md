You should report any health and safety concerns immediately to the \[TIOF] Team Human Resources Coordinator.

## Health and Safety is a collective effort

All Members share responsibility for achieving safe working conditions. You must take care of your own health and safety and that of others, observe applicable safety rules and follow instructions for the safe use of equipment. You must co-operate with Management on health and safety matters, including the investigation of any incident.

Failure to comply with this policy may be treated as misconduct and dealt with under our [Disciplinary Procedure](http://tiof.click/ProcedureDisciplinary).

## Information and consultation

We will inform and consult the Health and Safety Officer or directly with all staff regarding health and safety matters.

We will ensure that you are given adequate training and supervision to perform your responsibilities competently and safely. Members will be given a Health and Safety Induction and provided with appropriate safety training.

## Equipment

You must use equipment in accordance with any instructions given to you. Any equipment fault or damage must immediately be reported to the Health and Safety Officer. Do not attempt to repair equipment unless trained to do so.

Details of first aid facilities and the names of trained first aiders are made available on our [TIOF internal communication Channels](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/TIOF/wiki/Media-Kit#Internal-Communications).

All accidents and injuries at work, however minor, should be reported to

## Fire safety

All Members should familiarize themselves with the fire safety instructions in their physical offices (when applicable), which are displayed on notice boards and near fire exits in the workplace.

This should also be considered should the Member perform duties remotely.

If you hear a fire alarm, leave the building immediately by the nearest fire exit and go to the fire assembly point outside of the premises.

For physical offices, fire drills will be held at least every 12 months and must be taken seriously; we also carry out regular fire risk assessments and regular checks of fire extinguishers, fire alarms, escape routes and emergency lighting.

## Risk assessments and measures to control risk

We carry out general workplace risk assessments periodically, both in physical offices and remotely. The purpose is to assess the risks to health and safety of Members, visitors and other third parties as a result of our activities and to identify any measures that need to be taken to control those risks.
