## Fire safety

All Members should familiarize themselves with the fire safety instructions in their physical offices (when applicable), which are displayed on notice boards and near fire exits in the workplace.

This should also be considered should the Member perform duties remotely.

If you hear a fire alarm, leave the building immediately by the nearest fire exit and go to the fire assembly point outside of the premises.

For physical offices, fire drills will be held at least every 12 months and must be taken seriously; we also carry out regular fire risk assessments and regular checks of fire extinguishers, fire alarms, escape routes and emergency lighting.

## Risk assessments and measures to control risk

We carry out general workplace risk assessments periodically, both in physical offices and remotely. The purpose is to assess the risks to health and safety of Members, visitors and other third parties as a result of our activities and to identify any measures that need to be taken to control those risks.
