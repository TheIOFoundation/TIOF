## About

This section contains all annual reports issued by The IO Foundation, organized by fiscal year.

## Financial Reports

In compliance with the Estonian law, TIOF files an annual financial report to the Estonian authorities which is previously verified by an Estonian-licensed auditor.

### Fiscal Year

The IO Foundation is a registered non-profit in Estonia. It's fiscal year is defined from 1st January to 31st December.

## Impact Reports

The IO Foundation equally wishes to issue annual reports on its activities and impact assessment.

At the date of writing this has been impossible due to lack of resources and concentrating efforts in producing research and generating impact.

The organization is nonetheless actively working on this subject and will make all possible efforts to issue an Impact Report as soon as possible.

### Impact Year

Following the same timing as its Fiscal Year, TIOF's Impact Reports range from 1st January to 31st December of the reviewed year.
