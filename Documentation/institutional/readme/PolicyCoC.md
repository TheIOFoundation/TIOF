### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

* All [TIOF Members](https://tiof.click/TIOFTerminology/#members)
* All [TIOF Contributors](https://tiof.click/TIOFTerminology/#contributors)

This Code of Conduct applies within all TIOF spaces, including (although not limited to) management activities, project contributions or events, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the broader community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include (although not limited to) using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account or acting as an appointed representative at an event (online or offline).

### Our Personal Pledge

We as members, contributors and leaders pledge to make the participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of any personal characteristic dimension that essentially amplifies differences among people instead of embracing their similarities.

By participating in this project, we pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming and healthy community.

We likewise pledge to strive to achieve TIOF's [mission](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/TIOF/wiki#mission) and [vision](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/TIOF/wiki#vision) by embracing its [values](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/TIOF/wiki#values), which will inform our decisions at all times. Finally, we will be observant of the [Dhatham House Rule](http://tiof.click/Dhatam) in all of our digital interactions.

### The Organization's Pledge

As an international organization that heavily relies in the free exchange of ideas, we pledge that:

* We will never discipline or fire members of staff, dismiss volunteers or any other member associated with TIOF on the basis of pressure from online activism or other shapes of public & private pressure and/or shaming. We respect and adhere to both the principles of intent and of presumption of innocence and will always proceed with due diligence to investigate and resolve conflict under the framework provided by the Law.
* We have no interest in our members' political opinions and how they choose to express themselves outside the workplace is by no means up to TIOF to judge or act upon.
* We will not probe into our members' thoughts with ‚Äúunconscious bias training‚Äù (or any such similar initiatives) or force them to undertake workshops that _presuppose_ the existence of ‚Äúsystemic injustice‚Äù in any form or shape.
* TIOF will always circumscribe its statements and work strictly to its advocacy of [Data-Centric Digital Rights](http://tiof.click/Advocacy), unburdened by fealty to any other causes, political or ideological, or claims to promote certain ‚Äúvalues‚Äù. Our sole aim is to make a positive impact to promote better and safer technology under the guidance of the [DCDR Principles](http://tiof.click/Principles).
* While we won't engage and waste time and resources in such public debates, we will not tolerate the public shaming of members if they cause offense (even perceived), either through a joke or poor phrasing, and will instead seek to resolve internally the disputes that naturally occur when human beings work together. We recognize that absolutely everyone is a person in constant evolution and change and therefore care about intentions just as much as consequences.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Acting rationally
* Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting _constructive_ feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes and learning from the experience
* Refusing to weaponize others' mistakes
* Focusing on what is best, not just for us as individuals but for the overall community and project

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as (although not limited to) a physical or email address, without their explicit permission Please refer the [Dhatham House Rule](http://tiof.click/Dhatam)
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Enforcement Responsibilities

TIOF leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior described in this Code of Conduct and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful.

TIOF leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

### Enforcement
