### About this document

This document sets out the position maintained by TIOF in matters of Equality of Opportunities that you will need to be aware of while being a Member for TIOF. You should familiarize yourself with it and comply with it at all times. Any questions you may have with regard to its contents or what you have to do to comply with it should be referred to your corresponding Team Human Resources Coordinator.

This policy sets out our approach to equal opportunities and the avoidance of discrimination at work. It applies to all aspects of employment with us, including recruitment, pay and conditions, training, appraisals, promotion, conduct at work, disciplinary and grievance procedures, and termination of employment.

Any Member who breaches this Policy will face disciplinary action, which could result in dismissal for gross misconduct. Any non-employee who breaches this Policy may have their contract (or equivalent official relationship with TIOF) terminated with immediate effect.

This document complements TIOF's [Code of Conduct](http://tiof.click/TIOFPolicyCoC)

This document does not form part of any [Engagement Document](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/TIOF/wiki/Terminology#engagement-document) and we may amend it at any time.

### Scope

This document directly applies to:

* All [TIOF Members](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/TIOF/wiki/Terminology#member)

This document indirectly applies to:

* All [TIOF Contributors](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/TIOF/wiki/Terminology#contributors)

The policies and/or procedures set out in this document apply to all TIOF Members unless otherwise indicated. They therefore apply to Directors, Advisers, Counselors, Staff, Volunteers and Interns; this is irrespective of their part-time, fixed-term or casual status. They equally apply to all [Contributors](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/TIOF/wiki/Terminology#contributors) and will be used as part of the selection criteria when engaging with them.

This document applies within all TIOF spaces, including (although not limited to) management activities, project contributions or events, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the broader community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include (although not limited to) using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account or acting as an appointed representative at an event (online or offline).

## Policy details

### Equal opportunities statement

The IO Foundation is committed to promoting equal opportunities for individuals to become TIOF Members. You and any other applicants, irrespective of the position or type of engagement, will receive equal treatment regardless of any personal characteristic dimension that essentially amplifies differences among people instead of embracing their similarities.

### Discrimination

You must not unlawfully discriminate against or harass other people including current and former employees, job applicants, clients, customers, suppliers and visitors. This applies in the workplace, outside the workplace (when dealing with customers, suppliers or other work-related contacts) and on work-related trips or events, including social events.

The following forms of discrimination are prohibited under this Policy and are unlawful:

* Direct discrimination: treating someone less favorably because of a given personal characteristic dimension.
* Indirect discrimination: a provision, criterion or practice that applies to everyone but adversely affects people with a particular personal characteristic dimension more than others and is not justified.
* Victimization: treating someone that has complained or has supported someone else's complaint about discrimination or harassment less favorably. Harassment is dealt with further in our [Anti-harassment and Anti-Bullying Policy](http://tiof.click/TIOFPolicyAHAB).

### Recruitment and selection

Recruitment, promotion and other selection exercises such as redundancy selection will be conducted exclusively on the basis of merit and strictly following objective criteria that avoid discrimination. Shortlisting should be done by more than one person if possible.

Vacancies should generally be advertised in all official [Human Resources Channels](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/TIOF/wiki/Media-Kit#human-resources). Advertisements should avoid stereotyping or using wording that may discourage particular citizens from applying.

Applicants should not be asked questions which might suggest an intention to discriminate on grounds of any given personal characteristic dimension. Should the question be unavoidable, it must be done on the grounds of examining options to overcome observed difficulties.

Applicants should not be asked about health or disability before a position offer is made, except in the very limited circumstances allowed by law: for example, to check that the applicant could perform an intrinsic part of the job (taking account of any reasonable adjustments) or to see if any adjustments might be needed at the interview because of a disability. Where necessary, position offers can be made conditional on a satisfactory medical check.

Health or disability questions may be included in equal opportunities monitoring forms, which must not be used for selection or decision-making purposes.

### Disabilities

If you are disabled or become disabled, we encourage you to tell us about your condition so that we can consider what reasonable adjustments or support may be appropriate. In any case, this is not mandatory unless the disability affects your ability to perform your responsibilities as described in your [Engagement Document](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/TIOF/wiki/Terminology#engagement-document).

### Part-time and fixed-term work

Part-time and fixed-term Members should be treated the same as comparable full-time or permanent Members and enjoy no less favorable terms and conditions (on a pro-rata basis where appropriate), unless different treatment is (and must be) justified.

Back to top

### Breaches of this Policy

We take a strict approach to breaches of this Policy, which will be dealt with in accordance with our [Disciplinary Procedures](http://tiof.click/ProcedureDisciplinary). Serious cases of deliberate discrimination may amount to gross misconduct resulting in dismissal.

If you believe that you have suffered discrimination you can raise the matter through our [Grievance Procedures](http://tiof.click/ProcedureGrievance) or [Anti-harassment and Bullying Policy](http://tiof.click/TIOFPolicyAHAB). Complaints will be treated in confidence and investigated as appropriate.

You must not be victimized or retaliated against for complaining about discrimination. However, making a false allegation deliberately and in bad faith will be treated as misconduct and dealt with under our [Disciplinary Procedure](http://tiof.click/ProcedureDisciplinary) with the same determination as the allegation.
