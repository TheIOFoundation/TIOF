## The organization

The IO Foundation (TIOF) is a global for-impact NGO born from a fundamental concern about the state of technology in the world and advocating for [Data-Centric Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy).

As societies become inevitably digital, _their architects and builders need to embrace their fundamental role as the_ [_Next Generation of Rights defenders_](https://tiof.click/TIOFNextGen).

There remains, however, a limited international understanding of the true impact of technology on citizens and their digital twins as data becomes an increasingly powerful economic, political and social force.

TIOF aims to raise awareness of the importance of [Data-Centric Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy) in collaboration with stakeholders ranging from civil society, programmer communities, bodies of governance and corporate and work together to achieve the proclamation and adoption of a [Universal Declaration of Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/UDDRWeb).

The IO Foundation advances its [Data-Centric Digital Rights advocacy](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy) through the implementation of a number of [initiatives](../../initiatives.md).

### Mission

> To promote, protect and provide solutions for Data-Centric Digital Rights.

### Vision

> A world where Human Rights and Data-Centric Digital Rights are one and the same.

## The observed problem

The IO Foundation has observed the following problems:

* The nature of data is largely misunderstood
  * With currently 11 definitions of data worldwide, if we can't agree on that basic concept it will be virtually impossible to protect it effectively cross-borders.
* Technology is too complex for citizens and doesn't protect them properly
  * Current regulations place too much burden on the citizens' shoulders.
* Technology, and in particular software, does not have a way to prove compliance to data protection laws in an objective, standardized manner
  * In any properly regulated industry, companies only compete at value proposition level. In technology, they also compete at compliance level; enduring trust is not possible.&#x20;
* Experts do not have the necessary tools to be at the forefront of architecting and implementing better and safer technology
  * Policy makers and civil society at large keeps ignoring that engineers require being spoken too in a language they understand: clear, precise and definable problems + algorithms.
* Citizens should only be expected to be responsible citizens and not hackers
* Governments are increasingly becoming irrelevant by not being able to protect their own citizens' data

## The TIOF Initiatives

The IO Foundation advances its [Data-Centric Digital Rights advocacy](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy) through the implementation of a number of initiatives.

### Diagram

The following diagram provides an overview on how each of the initiatives support each other to advance TIOF's [Mission](https://tiof.click/TIOFMission) in realizing its [Vision](https://tiof.click/TIOFVision).

## [Data-Centric Digital Rights](http://localhost:5000/o/-MF3oKZXzZjSRVKTjwWS/s/rG4xcNzldvEoKR9FS7Og/ "mention")

TIOF views the technology as currently non-correlated with all working understandings and practices as to how any public-consumption industry functions traditionally where a clear separation is made between:

* Experts, who understand the complexities to design and build products that are compliant with applicable legislation and
* Citizens, who are solely tasked for being responsible users of the product

{% hint style="info" %}
As core stakeholders, technologists play a critical role as the [Next Generation of Rights Defenders](https://tiof.click/TIOFNextGen) and need to orient themselves through new design and implementation paradigms focused on protecting data. The [DCDR Principles](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciples) put forward by The IO Foundation are concepts that help them navigate the intricacies of applying Human and Digital Rights in digital infrastructures, products and services.
{% endhint %}

In essence, DCDR is a framework for technologists composed by Principles, Taxonomies and other technical tools. It enables them to develop a deeper understanding about the nature of data, the digital twins that emerge from it and make possible for them to embrace their role as [NextGen Rights Defenders](https://tiof.click/TIOFNextGen).

{% hint style="success" %}
By understanding that [_we are our data_](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciple1), technologists may architect Digital Spaces that aim at [_ending remedy_](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciple2) and build it so that they implement [_Rights by design_](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciple3).
{% endhint %}

### Objectives

The DCDR initiative aims at encouraging a shift in the current technology paradigms by providing

* [DCDR Principles](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciples)
* [Sagan Oath](https://tiof.click/DCDRSaganOath)
* Generating the necessary body of work for
  * A [DCDR framework](https://tiof.click/DCDRFramework)
  * A set of taxonomies for
    * [Digital Harms](https://tiof.click/DCDRDigitalHarms)
    * [Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/DCDRDigitalRights)
    * [Use Cases](https://tiof.click/DCDRUseCases)
