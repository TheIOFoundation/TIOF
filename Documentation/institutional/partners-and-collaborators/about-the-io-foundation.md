## The organization

The IO Foundation (TIOF) is a global for-impact NGO born from a fundamental concern about the state of technology in the world and advocating for [Data-Centric Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy).

As societies become inevitably digital, _their architects and builders need to embrace their fundamental role as the_ [_Next Generation of Rights defenders_](https://tiof.click/TIOFNextGen).

There remains, however, a limited international understanding of the true impact of technology on citizens and their digital twins as data becomes an increasingly powerful economic, political and social force.

TIOF aims to raise awareness of the importance of [Data-Centric Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy) in collaboration with stakeholders ranging from civil society, programmer communities, bodies of governance and corporate and work together to achieve the proclamation and adoption of a [Universal Declaration of Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/UDDRWeb).

The IO Foundation advances its [Data-Centric Digital Rights advocacy](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy) through the implementation of a number of [initiatives](../../initiatives.md).

### Mission

> To promote, protect and provide solutions for Data-Centric Digital Rights.

### Vision

> A world where Human Rights and Data-Centric Digital Rights are one and the same.

## The observed problem

The IO Foundation has observed the following problems:

* The nature of data is largely misunderstood
  * With currently 11 definitions of data worldwide, if we can't agree on that basic concept it will be virtually impossible to protect it effectively cross-borders.
* Technology is too complex for citizens and doesn't protect them properly
  * Current regulations place too much burden on the citizens' shoulders.
* Technology, and in particular software, does not have a way to prove compliance to data protection laws in an objective, standardized manner
  * In any properly regulated industry, companies only compete at value proposition level. In technology, they also compete at compliance level; enduring trust is not possible.&#x20;
* Experts do not have the necessary tools to be at the forefront of architecting and implementing better and safer technology
  * Policy makers and civil society at large keeps ignoring that engineers require being spoken too in a language they understand: clear, precise and definable problems + algorithms.
* Citizens should only be expected to be responsible citizens and not hackers
* Governments are increasingly becoming irrelevant by not being able to protect their own citizens' data
