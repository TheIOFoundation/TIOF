## About



As of this writing, TIOF is currently looking into forming its Board of Directors that will contribute mainly in organizational governance specifically in looking into whether the programs of TIOF are within the scope of its mission and vision.

TIOF hopes to gather a Board of Directors who are present in the various sections of its work such as Human Rights and Digital Spaces as well as in crucial components of organizational management such administrative, fiscal and legal aspects.

The ideal composition would be one Director per country where TIOF has presence so that each has its own voice in the Board. These Directors shall also represent TIOF in events and actively seek for support from local stakeholders.
