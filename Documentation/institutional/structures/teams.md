𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝗘𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀: Researching sources, encoding data points and reviewing it for a solid database. \
Human Rights are at the forefront of everything we do on the editing team; we are Human Rights Advocates who research, verify, and encode data to provide up to date, accurate data that tracks all of the Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) implemented globally. We are responsible for researching every territory in detail to gain a picture of the legal status of the territory, and a comprehensive timeline of events in terms of government measures and legislation. We work at national, as well as divisional, or regional levels, to understand fully how a territory is responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. Sources are all verified and whenever possible, are obtained from official Government documents. All the information contained in the source relevant to our database is encoded and is then automatically displayed on the Project Lockdown website.
