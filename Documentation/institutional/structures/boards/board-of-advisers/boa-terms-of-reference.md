This Agreement and any documents attached hereto as Exhibits constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein and therein, and supersede and replace any and all prior agreements and understandings, whether oral or written with respect to such matters.

**c. Severability, Enforcement**

**d. Governing Law**

In accordance to the Organization's Statute, the validity, interpretation, enforceability, and performance of this ToR shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Estonia.
