So far, the expected (yet unconfirmed) roles would be along the lines of:

* Chapter secretary
* Website manager
* Comms coordinator
* Events coordinator
* Partners coordinator
* HR (including Membership) coordinator

## Activities

For the time being, the only scheduled event is the First Meeting, where the CC Malaysia Chapter is to be officially constituted. One of the items in the [agenda](https://dothe.click/CCMYSAboutUs) is to discuss what should be the next events for 2021. Come and propose!

### Proposing Activities

See above.

## Calendar

One of the action items to be implemented by the CC Malaysia Chapter should be publishing its events through a publicly accessible calendar.

## Media Channels

Currently, the following media channels are being considered:

* Website (Wordpress - likely to be provided by CC GNC)
* Twitter (currently unclear who is handling this - working on it - If you know, please reach out to us: CCMYS@TheIOFoundation.org)
* LinkedIn (recently registered)

All these will require proper management, for which the Chapter will need to source adequate tools.

### Website

While we Chapter is constituted, the Temp Website will be a combination of:

* [Wiki](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/TIOF/wiki/Creative-Commons-Malaysia-Chapter) page
  * To publish information on the ongoing processes
* [Start.me](https://dothe.click/CCMYSAboutUs) page
  * to publish a collection of relevant links

Once the Chapter obtains its own website all this information will be migrated there.

### Media Policy

Another relevant policy that the Chapter will need to establish will be its Media Policy.
